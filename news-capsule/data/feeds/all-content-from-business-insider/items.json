The tour follows the release of his latest album, Play, and features a blend of brand-new material and chart-topping hits.  Tickets are currently available through verified resale platforms, though many dates are expected to sell out quickly due to high demand. Here&#39;s how to get Ed Sheeran tickets if you&#39;re ready to secure your seats.</p><p>Ed Sheeran first broke into the mainstream in the early 2010s with his debut album + (Plus) and the single &#34;The A Team,&#34; quickly becoming one of the most-streamed and awarded artists globally. With multiple Grammy Awards, chart-dominating albums like ÷ (Divide) and = (Equals), and record-breaking tours under his belt, Sheeran has redefined the modern singer-songwriter. His live shows are known for their authenticity &mdash; often performed solo onstage with just a guitar, a loop pedal, and a captivated audience.</p><p>With the 2026 LOOP Tour, Sheeran continues to build on that legacy, offering both a fresh chapter and a celebration of the music that made him a global sensation.

On Vivid Seats, fans can often find some of the lowest resale listings starting around $70&ndash;$90 for upper-level or less in-demand seats at U.S. stadium shows, such as Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta or Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte. These lower‑tier listings provide one of the more affordable ways to see Sheeran live after primary ticket sales sell out.</p><p>StubHub similarly offers a range of entry-level resale options, often in the same price range as Vivid Seats. Because StubHub’s marketplace is backed by its FanProtect Guarantee, buyers can shop with confidence that they’ll receive valid tickets or a comparable replacement. At the opposite end of the spectrum, premium seats, like lower‑bowl sections, front‑row views, or VIP packages, can fetch several hundred dollars and even exceed $1,000 on resale, especially for high‑demand stops such as Foxborough’s Gillette Stadium or shows in major media markets. </p><p>Overall, standard resale ticket prices for Ed Sheeran’s 2026 tour typically range from around $70 to $100 for the most affordable seats, up into the low to mid hundreds for better viewing sections, with premium listings and VIP experiences climbing well beyond that, based on demand and location.</p><hr/><p>See also: <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/stubhub-review-fees\">Is StubHub legit?</a> | <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-buy-ariana-grande-tickets-concert-tour\">Ariana Grande tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-pinkpantheress-tickets-concert-tour\">PinkPantheress tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-cardi-b-concert-tickets-tour\">Cardi B tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-buy-twice-tickets-concert-tour\">Twice tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-bad-bunny-tickets-concert-tour\">Bad Bunny tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-lily-allen-tickets-concert-tour\">Lily Allen tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-florence-and-the-machine-tickets-concert-tour\">Florence and the Machine tickets</a></p><p><em>Follow our </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\" nofollow\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb2J5x9J3juulcffA60F\"><em>WhatsApp channel</em></a><em> and </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\" nofollow\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/insiderreviews/\"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> for more deals and buying guides.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-buy-ed-sheeran-tickets-concert-tour\">Business Insider</a></div>",

The expanded run supports her growing catalog of genre-blending pop, UK garage, and drum &amp; bass-infused tracks, with new dates across North America and Mexico, including performances at Coachella and major cities such as Seattle, Phoenix, Houston, Miami, Washington, D.C., Brooklyn, and Montreal.

For those seeking an affordable way to attend, Vivid Seats currently lists the lowest-priced tickets starting around $28 to $30, depending on the city and venue. On average, most listings hover near the $115 to $120 mark, offering decent value for a rising star whose shows are selling out fast.</p><p>Over on StubHub, prices follow a similar pattern. Entry-level seats are available in the same price range; however, premium options &mdash; such as front-row or center-stage spots &mdash; can run several hundred dollars, especially in cities like Miami, Orlando, or Montreal. StubHub&#39;s FanProtect Guarantee ensures that you&#39;ll either receive valid tickets on time or receive a comparable replacement or refund.</p><p>Whether you&#39;re after budget seats or looking to splurge on a prime view, resale platforms offer flexible choices &mdash; but prices tend to rise closer to the show date. For the best selection and pricing, it&#39;s smart to shop early and compare listings across both StubHub and Vivid Seats.</p><hr/><p>See also: <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/stubhub-review-fees\">Is StubHub legit?</a> | <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-buy-ariana-grande-tickets-concert-tour\">Ariana Grande tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-katseye-tickets-concert-tour\">Katseye tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-cardi-b-concert-tickets-tour\">Cardi B tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-buy-blackpink-tickets-concert-tour\">Blackpink tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-buy-twice-tickets-concert-tour\">Twice tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-bad-bunny-tickets-concert-tour\">Bad Bunny tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-lily-allen-tickets-concert-tour\">Lily Allen tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-florence-and-the-machine-tickets-concert-tour\">Florence and the Machine tickets</a></p><p><em>Follow our </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\" nofollow\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb2J5x9J3juulcffA60F\"><em>WhatsApp channel</em></a><em> and </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\" nofollow\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/insiderreviews/\"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> for more deals and buying guides.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-get-pinkpantheress-tickets-concert-tour\">Business Insider</a></div>",

The White House did not immediately respond to requests for clarification.</p><p>Trump&#39;s proposal for his representatives to buy housing bonds comes on the heels of a Wednesday statement made by the president, in which he said he would ban &#34;<a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-block-institutional-investors-owning-single-family-homes-blackstone-2026-1\">large institutional investors</a>&#34; from buying single-family homes in the US.</p><p>Business Insider previously reported that many housing economists say such a ban would do little to improve national housing affordability. It is unclear what effect Trump&#39;s latest proposal would have on the market.  </p><p>Richard Green, director and chair of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate, told Business Insider that Trump&#39;s proposal doesn&#39;t go far enough to solve the fundamental problem with American housing, which is that there simply aren&#39;t enough homes for each person who wants to buy one.</p><p class=\"has-focus\">However, he added, even the $200 billion proposal is more symbolic than substantive.</p><p>&#34;When the Fed was involved in buying mortgages, they were buying trillions, right? So this is a gesture, I suppose,&#34; Green said. &#34;And of course, if you drop interest rates down, it will show up at higher house prices, which means that down payment becomes more difficult.&#34;</p><p class=\"has-focus\">&#34;So it&#39;s not like magic, that if you push down mortgage interest rates, that you&#39;re going to make housing less or more affordable,&#34; Green added. &#34;But the big thing is that $200 billion sounds like a big number, but in context, it&#39;s not all that much.&#34;</p><p>Trump&#39;s plan also came just a day after he signed an executive order that bans <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-defense-contractor-executive-order-restrict-buybacks-dividend-salaries-2026-1\">defense contractors</a> from stock buybacks and dividends unless they meet certain standards.</p><p>The approach fits with a broader shift in Trump&#39;s second-term economic playbook, as previously reported by Business Insider&#39;s Emily Stewart. The Trump administration seems to have embraced a more <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-era-america-capitalism-socialist-trump-economy-2026-1\">interventionist style of capitalism</a>, with the federal government taking a more active role in markets, including holding direct stakes in private companies.</p><p>Trump&#39;s latest rhetoric also appears to target the affordability crisis as frustration over prices builds and as midterm elections near.</p><p>Housing, food, and everyday expenses remain stubbornly expensive since Trump took office for the second time, and his tariffs did not help. <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/zohran-mamdani-proposals-how-much-they-will-cost-affordability-childcare-2025-10\">Zohran Mamdani</a>, the new mayor of NYC, who had a meeting with Trump, notably won by running on universal childcare and affordable housing. According to a poll by Lake Research Partners in October 2025, support for affordability and living-wage policies in competitive swing districts is high and would give candidates who run on economic issues an advantage.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-said-representatives-to-buy-mortgage-bonds-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

But an accompanying executive order, also issued Wednesday night, offered more nuance.</p><p>The executive order also begins with a lengthy complaint criticizing defense contractors for pursuing &#34;more lucrative contracts&#34; while delivering late and over budget on existing ones.</p><p>In the eleventh paragraph, the executive order explains how the Defense Department would enforce Trump&#39;s priorities: Through the enforcement of future contracts.</p><p>The order requires Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth to ensure that, in future military contracts, the executive compensation for contractors isn&#39;t tied to &#34;short-term financial metrics,&#34; but to increased production, delivery time, and other improvements &#34;required to rapidly expand our United States stockpiles and capabilities.&#34;</p><p>Trump&#39;s order doesn&#39;t include the $5 million salary cap that he posted about on social media. Instead, it empowers Hegseth to require contractors to cap executive base salaries at existing levels if they don&#39;t meet the Defense Department secretary&#39;s performance expectations.</p><p>It also requires the government&#39;s defense contracts to forbid companies from issuing stock buybacks and other payments to shareholders during periods when they have not met Hegseth&#39;s expectations.</p><p>Trump&#39;s order gives Hegseth wide discretion to define the &#34;period of underperformance&#34; or &#34;insufficient prioritization of the contract&#34; where those restrictions kick in. The executive order says those definitions will be &#34;determined by the Secretary.&#34;</p><p>The arrangement &#34;puts the Secretary of War into the shoes of the Securities Exchange Commission&#34; by giving Hegseth the power to determine how the companies can handle their finances, said Harold Koh, a professor of national security law at Yale Law School.</p><p>&#34;Their policy with regard to corporate distributions is a matter of corporate finance, Koh said. &#34;It&#39;s not a matter of defense performance.&#34;</p><p>The executive order, in essence, is a directive on how the Defense Department &mdash; which the Trump administration calls the War Department &mdash; should treat military contracts in the future.</p><p>The companies can accept those terms, or lose out on contracts that could instead go to competitors.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s really a question of whether the contractor accepts those terms,&#34; said said Koh, who served as the top State Department lawyer during the Obama administration. &#34;It&#39;s a statement of policy about the way the contracts should be written going forward.&#34;</p><p>Trump issued the order at the same time he said he wants to <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-raise-us-military-budget-2027-2026-1\">dramatically increase the Pentagon&#39;s budget</a>. He announced he wanted to raise US military spending by 50%, from $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion.</p><p>In another social media post on Wednesday night, <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-threatens-raytheon-business-contracts-us-government-2026-1\">Trump took particular aim at Raytheon</a>, one of the largest Defense Department contractors. Trump said the company will not be allowed to do additional stock buybacks &#34;until they are able to get their act together.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I have been informed by the Department of War that Defense Contractor, Raytheon, has been the least responsive to the needs of the Department of War, the slowest in increasing their volume, and the most aggressive spending on their Shareholders rather than the needs and demands of the United States Military,&#34; Trump wrote.</p><p>Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said the order demonstrates the Defense Department&#39;s &#34;obligation is to our warfighters; not Wall Street.&#34;</p><p>&#34;After numerous years of failing to meet contractual obligations, under President Trump&#39;s order, defense contractors will no longer be allowed to leave our warfighters behind while giving themselves massive payouts from stock buybacks,&#34; Parnell said in a statement.</p><p>Koh told Business Insider that the executive order grants the Defense Secretary enormous discretion to determine whether particular companies meet manufacturing expectations. Hegseth could determine which companies can retain control over their executives&#39; salaries, and which ought to be capped, he said.</p><p>&#34;The order that was issued is only sort of half the story,&#34; Koh said. &#34;The question is: Where are the exemptions coming from? Who has the authority to exempt someone from these criteria because of their personal contacts?&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-defense-contractor-executive-order-restrict-buybacks-dividend-salaries-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

But there are still some issues with call quality and reliability. &#34;This is our biggest priority and the full team is working around the clock to restore service,&#34; he said.</p><p>The buzzy phone was launched in the fall of 2024 and spread quickly through word of mouth &mdash; especially in Facebook groups focused on parenting. The phones, which are colorful and corded, cost $75. It&#39;s free to call other Tin Can users (or you can pay $10 a month to call outside lines, similar to VoIP), which is what makes the service so popular with parents: They can create a sort of Tin Can closed circuit.</p><p>For Maria Pahuja, a parent in Richmond, Virginia, everything was working fine when she installed the Tin Can phone on Christmas Eve morning. &#34;It worked great, the kids were using it,&#34; she said. &#34;Then, Christmas morning, it stopped working.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Sometimes you&#39;d pick it up, and there would be a dial tone, you would call, and nothing would happen. Once in a while, a call would go through, and then two minutes later another call wouldn&#39;t,&#34; she said. &#34;It wasn&#39;t consistent.&#34;</p><h2 id=\"ddf39cd1-8bca-4dd2-8478-ca96cc522853\" data-toc-id=\"ddf39cd1-8bca-4dd2-8478-ca96cc522853\">Why parents are loving the concept of the Tin Can</h2><p>Business Insider&#39;s Conz Preti <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-a-landline-helped-my-kids-make-their-own-plans-2025-12\">bought a Tin Can for her kids in the fall</a> and is a big fan of it. She was delighted how, on a recent snow day, her kids used it to organize playdates for sledding &mdash; all on their own, without the parents having to act as social secretary.</p><p>(Full disclosure: I have also ordered one for my own kids. In a nod to what the company said is a paced timeline to make sure it can catch up with any tech issues, mine isn&#39;t scheduled to arrive until February.)</p><p>The concept of the Tin Can is appealing to parents like Conz and me, who have <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mom-struggling-no-cell-phone-rule-for-son-2025-12\">kids too young for cellphones</a> but are old enough to want to communicate with friends on their own. Although it&#39;s similar to an actual landline, it&#39;s not one: Tin Can works on WiFi. Parents can set it to make and receive calls only to and from approved contacts. And it can also be programmed to have a time limit and be silent during quiet hours.</p><h2 id=\"ace6052d-8438-4326-ba3e-d0e07ff51b38\" data-toc-id=\"ace6052d-8438-4326-ba3e-d0e07ff51b38\">The dads who founded Tin Can</h2><p>The company was founded by Kittleson, Max Blumen, and Graeme Davies based on a desire to create something for their own kids. They raised $3.5 million in funding for the company from investors, including Pioneer Square Ventures, Newfund Capital, Mother Ventures, and Solid Foundation. Since December 2025, they have raised an additional $12 million from Greylock Partners, bringing the total to $15.5 million, the company said.</p><p>In late August 2025, Kittleson told Business Insider they had sold &#34;tens of thousands&#34; of the devices so far. The company didn&#39;t have an updated sales figure to share.</p><p>Even the disappointment of the tech issues with the phone is a teaching moment, one parent said.</p><p>&#34;Part of what we&#39;re trying to teach kids is patience and accountability,&#34; said Joy Engel, a parent of a 5- and 8-year-old who lives outside Portland, Maine. She received the Tin Can she ordered over the summer on the first day of Hannukkah, and her kids have loved it, even with the service outages in late December.</p><p>&#34;The company has been so forthright in what they say and how they&#39;ve communicated and stopped charging people. That&#39;s accountability,&#34; she said.</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s a patience there that you&#39;re teaching them that you can&#39;t always get what you want right now. &#39;&#39;<em>Your friend&#39;s not there, that stinks. You&#39;re gonna have to wait and call them back. The phone doesn&#39;t work. That stinks. You&#39;re going to have to wait and try again,</em>&#34; she said.</p><p>For now, the Tin Can is backordered until April. Not because of manufacturing constraints, Kittleson told Business Insider, but to pace the onboarding of the service.</p><p><em>Update: January 8, 2026 &mdash; Tin Can in December raised an additional $12 million, to bring its total fundraise to $15.5 million, the company said</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tin-can-crashed-outage-christmas-kids-parenting-landline-phone-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

He has also recently incorporated other entities in Delaware, including a vehicle used to fund influenza research and another used for his flying car ventures.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear what the entity tied to Brin and Page does. The filing describes T-Rex Holdings as a &#34;management company.&#34; Like other ultrawealthy executives, Brin and Page have used LLCs as flexible vehicles to hold assets or manage investments, often with little public disclosure. The LLC&#39;s name may be a reference to <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/words-only-googlers-understand-2018-1#stan-in-the-googleplex-youll-meet-stan-googles-own-statue-of-a-t-rex-skeleton-stan-is-there-to-remind-the-company-to-never-become-a-dinosaur-at-least-thats-one-theory-3\">Stan, a bronze T. rex statue</a> that presides over Google&#39;s headquarters in Mountain View, California.</p><p>Brin, who cofounded Google with Page in 1998, is associated with several other entities in California, including the Sergey Brin Family Foundation and Bayshore Global Management, which acts as his family office. Filings do not show any other entity associated with Brin leaving California.</p><p>Page and Brin are, respectively, the second and fourth-richest people on the planet, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Each has a net worth exceeding $250 billion.</p><p>After stepping back from executive roles in 2019, the two have taken differing paths. <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-cofounder-sergey-brin-ai-io-conference\">Brin has returned to hands-on work at Google</a>.

Figure out what is most important to you before booking.</p><p>Do you want the best, Broadway-level entertainment? A unique itinerary? Incredible food?</p><p>You might also opt for an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/reasons-virgin-voyages-cruises-best-value-from-frequent-cruiser-2024-1\">adults-only cruise</a> or a sailing designed for families if you&#39;re bringing kids. Do your research.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"af89d673-7b14-432b-88be-3dccde9e33c0\" data-toc-id=\"af89d673-7b14-432b-88be-3dccde9e33c0\">Flying to the port city on the day your cruise is leaving&nbsp;</h2><p>I&#39;ve seen many people miss their cruise because they didn&#39;t account for possible delays when heading to where their ship is taking off.</p><p>If you&#39;re flying into your departure city, consider arriving there a day or two before your ship sets sail. That way, you&#39;ll have plenty of time to board and not have to worry if your flight gets pushed back a few hours.</p><h2 id=\"9087680c-0862-40db-a1ab-02dd525510c7\" data-toc-id=\"9087680c-0862-40db-a1ab-02dd525510c7\">Failing to research the port or destinations before boarding the ship</h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/63d3fb164589790018e57abd?format=jpeg\" height=\"2242\" width=\"2989\" charset=\"\" alt=\"port of miami with cruise ships docked in blue-green waters\"/><figcaption>It&#39;s not the cruise line&#39;s fault you failed to plan.<p class=\"copyright\">pisaphotography/Shutterstock</p></figcaption></figure><p>Many people embark on a cruise without researching the history of the places they&#39;re visiting and sailing through. I think that&#39;s a huge mistake because a bit of research can <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/advice-for-first-time-cruisers-from-ship-employee-2022-8\">make your trip richer</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>There will likely be an onboard presentation or two about shore excursions or a guest speaker telling you about the area you&#39;re about to visit, but that&#39;s only a small piece of the puzzle.</p><p>When doing your own research before sailing, you may find ideas for things to do on shore, pick up a few fun facts, or learn about a few common mistakes tourists to the area make that you can avoid.</p><h2 id=\"3f39c071-544d-4c32-a1ab-9927357f574f\" data-toc-id=\"3f39c071-544d-4c32-a1ab-9927357f574f\">Skipping shore excursions&nbsp;</h2><p>At many destinations, you can walk from the ship into the port and find things to do. But there are places &mdash; especially in Asia, Central America, and Europe &mdash; where the ship will dock in a cargo area or shipyard, and you can&#39;t just walk into town.&nbsp;</p><p>In these cases, it helps to have booked an excursion or special tour. I recommend doing so through your cruise line because the ship will wait for you before leaving if your excursion or tour is running late.&nbsp;</p><p>I&#39;ve seen a lot of disappointed guests who didn&#39;t do their research and skipped excursions to save money. They spent most of the day trying to figure out how to get a taxi so they could actually explore the area they came to see.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=\"5cbc0211-8317-49f3-8580-c6f7578f433e\" data-toc-id=\"5cbc0211-8317-49f3-8580-c6f7578f433e\">Not buying the drink package even though you plan to regularly get alcoholic beverages</h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/63d306494589790018e566b2?format=jpeg\" height=\"2684\" width=\"3579\" charset=\"\" alt=\"cocktail on cruise ship\"/><figcaption>Drink packages are worth it for a lot of people.<p class=\"copyright\">Pavel L Photo and Video/Shutterstock</p></figcaption></figure><p>If you like your adult beverages and plan on ordering a few each day, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-cruise-drink-packages-are-not-worth-money-frequent-cruiser-opinion\">buying a drink package</a> is probably cost-effective. Every ship offers different packages for alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks.&nbsp;</p><p>The prices of drink packages are typically shocking, but you might feel worse if you skip the deal and see your alcohol bill at the end of the cruise.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, take the time to perform a few calculations before deciding whether to take the plunge.</p><h2 id=\"c14ce78a-2eca-4cfd-8e53-1a94f4cc6f4a\" data-toc-id=\"c14ce78a-2eca-4cfd-8e53-1a94f4cc6f4a\">Taking the daily added gratuities off of your cruise price</h2><p>Just like at restaurants in the US, tipping is part of cruising. Many cruises automatically add a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-lines-increasing-gratuity-wifi-fees-speciality-restaurants-2023-1\">daily gratuity fee</a> to bookings, but I&#39;ve seen some people remove it at the front desk.&nbsp;</p><p>Their reasoning is usually &#34;I&#39;ll tip who I want&#34; or &#34;I&#39;ll tip my room steward in cash at the end of the cruise.&#34;</p><p>But by doing this, you&#39;re only tipping the guest-facing crew members you see. How about the other dozens of crew doing their job behind the scenes?&nbsp;</p><p>In the name of fairness, I strongly advise against doing this.</p><h2 id=\"b43e949c-943f-4f77-a93f-c87ab81b7858\" data-toc-id=\"b43e949c-943f-4f77-a93f-c87ab81b7858\">Booking the wrong cabin&nbsp;</h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/63d3fb5dfc184700195514dc?format=jpeg\" height=\"1735\" width=\"2350\" charset=\"\" alt=\"bunk beds in a cruise ship cabin with window\"/><figcaption>Your ideal cabin type depends on your group size and other factors.<p class=\"copyright\">ER_09/Shutterstock</p></figcaption></figure><p>The location of your cabin can impact your entire trip.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, if you get seasick, you might want to book a room in a certain part of the ship &mdash; ideally, far from the bow. Or, if you&#39;re a light sleeper, it may be best to pick a cabin far from the elevators and main stairwells.</p><p>A travel agent can definitely help you <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cruise-room-recommendations-for-family-what-to-avoid-review-photos-2022-5\">select the right cabin</a> for your needs, especially if you&#39;re cruising for the first time.&nbsp;If you&#39;re booking on your own, look up maps of your ship and do some googling.</p><h2 id=\"3a56e7cd-c72e-47c4-9767-9224ce869602\" data-toc-id=\"3a56e7cd-c72e-47c4-9767-9224ce869602\">Complaining about noise and movements the whole cruise&nbsp;</h2><p>This is a floating hotel full of people. There will be noises and rocking.&nbsp;</p><p>You&#39;d think people would understand this, but many complain about being unable to sleep because of the ship&#39;s movement or a cracking sound in the wall. Expect both when cruising.</p><h2 id=\"5fce5c08-6df6-4681-9e3a-7856a87bf861\" data-toc-id=\"5fce5c08-6df6-4681-9e3a-7856a87bf861\">Not preparing to handle the changing weather</h2><p>The captain&#39;s job is to keep the guests and crew safe while sailing. Sometimes the captain needs to switch the itinerary to avoid <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/interesting-fun-things-about-working-on-a-cruise-ship-2021-5\">sailing into storms</a>, especially during hurricane season. Learn to accept it and make the most of it.&nbsp;</p><p>On a related note, the unpredictability of the weather is another reason I recommend people book their excursions through the cruise line. If we&#39;re late arriving at a port or we skip it entirely, the cruise line can typically fully refund your booked land activities.&nbsp;</p><p><em>This story was originally published on February 5, 2023, and most recently updated on January 8, 2025.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/things-never-do-first-cruise-cruise-director-tips-advice-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

The president said Raytheon has been &#34;the least responsive&#34; to the government&#39;s needs, slow in increasing volume, and has prioritized returning capital to shareholders over the military&#39;s priorities.</p><p>&#34;Either Raytheon steps up, and starts investing in more upfront Investment like Plants and Equipment, or they will no longer be doing business with&#34; the government, Trump said in a Truth Social post.</p><p>A spokesperson for RTX Corporation, formerly known as Raytheon, did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Business Insider. The company rebranded as RTX in 2023 following a merger with United Technologies Corporation.</p><p>Earlier in the day, Trump fired a broadside at the entire defense industry, posting on Truth Social that he would &#34;not permit&#34; further stock buybacks or dividends to be issued to shareholders. Trump also said that until defense companies build &#34;NEW and MODERN Production Plants&#34; their executives&#39; pay should be capped at $5 million.</p><p>Like its competitors, shares of RTX dropped after Trump&#39;s initial post about the industry. RTX rebounded in early after-hours trading, trending up more than 3% as of 6 p.m. ET.</p><p>It&#39;s unclear why Trump singled out Raytheon in particular. The company has a history of returning capital to shareholders. Raytheon announced a $10 billion buyback plan in 2023 and says it has paid a dividend every year since 1936.</p><p>Last year, the company paid out a <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.rtx.com/news/news-center/2025/01/31/rtx-board-of-directors-declares-quarterly-cash-dividend-5\">dividend in March</a>. It&#39;s unclear if Trump&#39;s statement will affect those plans or even the extent to which a president could prohibit a publicly traded company from fulfilling its previously declared financial obligations.</p><p>Trump has frequently used the presidential bully pulpit to <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ceos-trump-has-gone-after-dimon-cook-solomon-2025-8\">criticize companies and their CEOs</a>. In August 2025, Trump called for Intel to fire its CEO Lip-Bu Tan, only to later change his stance after the US government acquired a roughly 10% stake in the chipmaker.</p><p>It is less common for Trump to directly threaten a company&#39;s government contracts, although he has done so as well.</p><p>In July 2025, Trump threatened to cut off Elon Musk&#39;s companies from government contracts during a heated back-and-forth with the world&#39;s richest person.

And, far from helping us cut back on <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ultra-processed-food-expert-tips-for-avoiding-the-worst-2025-1\">ultra-processed foods</a>, the protein craze has been a boon for food manufacturing, as protein has been added to health-ify chips, candy, pastries, and cereal.</p><p>Here&#39;s what to know about the latest recommendations, how to figure out the right amount of protein for you, and the best ways to get it.</p><h2 id=\"1630a05a-46a9-4ada-85ab-0f1ce14537ae\" data-toc-id=\"1630a05a-46a9-4ada-85ab-0f1ce14537ae\"><strong>What&#39;s the big deal about protein?</strong></h2><p>There&#39;s no question that protein is an essential nutrient, helping to support healthy muscles and bones, regulate metabolism, and manage appetite.</p><p>It&#39;s also true that it can be challenging for some people to <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/underrated-high-protein-fiber-foods-dietitian-tips-2025-3\">get enough protein</a>.</p><p>For decades, women were urged to diet on protein-poor fad foods like cabbage soup and plain grapefruits, mistakenly thinking a hearty meal or heavy weight would make us bulky. Now, in part thanks to the rise of strength training, our appetites have come back with a vengeance, and protein is a major part of the menu.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695ecea7832e0ef1ead75ea2?format=jpeg\" height=\"5773\" width=\"8660\" charset=\"\" alt=\"a woman drinking a protein shake in the gym\"/><figcaption>Women are a major audience for protein products from shakes to snacks, fueled in part by the growing popularity of strength training.<p class=\"copyright\">ATHVisions/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>The recent boom of <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/weight-loss-glp-1-drugs-ozempic-wegovy-mounjaro-effects-future-2023-12\">GLP-1 drugs for weight loss</a> has also brought protein to the forefront, as Americans have pushed to hold on to muscle mass while losing fat.</p><p>Protein is also a crucial nutrient for longevity. As we get older, our muscle mass tends to naturally decline, which, if we&#39;re not careful, can lead to frailty and an increased risk of injury and illness. Eating enough protein as we age helps maintain muscle for more resilience and strength at age 60 and beyond.</p><p>Previous dietary guidelines focused on the bare minimum of protein you&#39;d need to avoid malnutrition, which is around 0.36 grams per pound of body weight (about 54 grams per day for a 150-pound person).</p><p>However, avoiding starvation is rarely the only goal of eating. Nutrition and exercise science suggest the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/how-much-protein-maximize-muscle-gains-2022-9\">optimal amount of protein</a> for building muscle is about twice that amount, about 0.7 grams per pound daily (105 grams for a 150-pound person). In a day, that translates to about 30 to 35 grams per meal.</p><h2 id=\"6bebc98f-a5fc-4c7b-908f-ce22dcd5d3ab\" data-toc-id=\"6bebc98f-a5fc-4c7b-908f-ce22dcd5d3ab\"><strong>Is protein overrated?</strong></h2><p id=\"6bebc98f-a5fc-4c7b-908f-ce22dcd5d3ab\">Today, some top TikTokers log themselves eating more than 100 grams of protein at a single meal, and 300 or more grams in a day. Great, if you&#39;re the Rock.</p><p>For the rest of us, there&#39;s no reason to spend that extra time, money, and energy on all that protein, said Dr. Federica Amati, medical scientist and head nutritionist at the nutrition app ZOE.</p><p>&#34;Definitely, I think it&#39;s overrated,&#34; she previously told Business Insider. &#34;The interest in protein isn&#39;t going anywhere because it&#39;s been ingrained, especially in the US culture.&#34;</p><p id=\"6bebc98f-a5fc-4c7b-908f-ce22dcd5d3ab\">Protein has been a mainstay of American nutrition for well over four decades: from the Atkins era in the 70s, peaking in the early aughts, to current keto, low-carb, and <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/carnivore-diet-claims-eating-only-meat-helps-fitness-weight-loss-2022-5\">carnivore diets</a>. Along the way, food fads alternatively demonized dietary fats and carbs. For any health-conscious person, what else was left to eat but more and more protein?</p><p id=\"6bebc98f-a5fc-4c7b-908f-ce22dcd5d3ab\">The problem, according to Amati and others, is that protein is hogging the spotlight from other key nutrients that play a major role in our health.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695ed0d704eda4732f2eac9c?format=jpeg\" height=\"3648\" width=\"5472\" charset=\"\" alt=\"a close-up of thick steaks on a cutting board with a few asparagus spears\"/><figcaption>Overloading protein can leave less room for veggies and other nutrient-dense foods.<p class=\"copyright\">Juefrateam/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p id=\"6bebc98f-a5fc-4c7b-908f-ce22dcd5d3ab\">&#34;If you just focus on telling people you need to eat one gram of protein for a kilogram of body weight, then you don&#39;t know what else is going on the plate,&#34; Amati said.</p><p id=\"6bebc98f-a5fc-4c7b-908f-ce22dcd5d3ab\">Fiber, for instance, plays a crucial role in gut health, metabolism, and longevity. And you&#39;re far more likely to be <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-spector-increase-fiber-plant-based-protein-sources-2025-1\">missing out on fiber</a> than protein, Amati said. Incidentally, the latest dietary guidelines put key sources of fiber, like beans and whole grains, near the bottom of the pyramid.</p><p id=\"6bebc98f-a5fc-4c7b-908f-ce22dcd5d3ab\">Even for athletes, who need extra protein to recover from the strain of exercise, can get <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/habits-that-look-healthy-heart-disease-failure-stroke-inflammation-2025-7\">too much protein</a>, cardiologist Dr. Dmitry Yaranov previously told Business Insider. Bodybuilders, for instance, look like the pinnacle of health, but &#34;end up with weak hearts and blocked arteries,&#34; he said.</p><h2 id=\"639966c4-aa26-42ef-9eb3-e68fd415b288\" data-toc-id=\"639966c4-aa26-42ef-9eb3-e68fd415b288\"><strong>How to get the right amount of protein for your goals</strong></h2><p>The latest dietary guidelines recommend between 0.6 and 0.9 grams of protein per pound of body weight daily, between 90 and 135 grams for a 150-pound person.</p><p>However, Amati said you don&#39;t need to track your grams of protein at all. If you simply must count your protein on a daily basis, she recommends calculating a percentage instead of the number of grams.</p><p>If you&#39;re eating around 2000 calories a day, 100 grams of protein would translate to about 20% of your diet, leaving the other 80% of your diet for more crucial nutrients.</p><p>&#34;What the percentage helps us do is focus on the importance of a varied diet,&#34; she said.</p><p>Protein sources also matter.</p><p>Meat makes up a large part of Kennedy&#39;s new vision of healthy eating in America (including our right to fries soaked in cattle fat), part of the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/government-eat-more-butter-full-fat-milk-dietary-guidelines-dairy-2026-1\">comeback movement for dairy</a>, butter, and other animal-based foods.</p><p>But red and processed meats (including trendy jerky snacks and deli meats) have consistently been linked to a higher risk of heart disease and some cancers.</p><p>Amati said your best bet is focusing on variety in your diet. If you&#39;re eating a range of foods &mdash; including plant-based protein sources like beans, nuts, and seeds &mdash; you&#39;ll get all the essential amino acids you need, along with plenty of fiber, vitamins, and minerals.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-protein-guidelines-how-to-eat-more-without-too-much-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Independent resale trackers indicate that secondary ticket prices for major concerts can start under $100 but escalate significantly, depending on the timing and popularity of the event.</p><p>Because ticket prices fluctuate with demand and availability, it’s worth checking multiple resale platforms and comparing listings to balance cost with seat quality for Combs’ 2026 tour.</p><hr/><p>See more: <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/stubhub-review-fees\"><u>Is StubHub legit?</u></a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/las-vegas-sphere-tickets-prices-schedule\"><u>Las Vegas Sphere tickets</u></a> | <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-chris-stapleton-tickets-concert-tour\">Chris Stapleton tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-kenny-chesney-concert-tickets\"><u>Kenny Chesney tickets</u></a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-buy-eagles-tickets-concert-tour\"><u>Eagles tickets</u></a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-zac-brown-band-tickets-concert-tour\"><u>Zac Brown Band tickets</u></a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-morgan-wallen-tickets-concert-tour\"><u>Morgan Wallen tickets</u></a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-ed-sheeran-tickets-concert-tour\"><u>Ed Sheeran tickets</u></a></p><p>Follow our <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\" nofollow\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb2J5x9J3juulcffA60F\"><u>WhatsApp channel</u></a> and <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\" nofollow\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/insiderreviews/\"><u>Instagram</u></a> for more deals and buying guides.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-buy-luke-combs-tickets-concert-tour\">Business Insider</a></div>",

A company spokesperson confirmed to Business Insider that this also means the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airline-companies-offer-discounted-fares-for-ice-deportation-2020-1\">end of its ICE contract</a>.</p><p>&#34;Avelo will close the base at [Mesa] on January 27 and will conclude participation in the DHS charter program,&#34; they said. &#34;The program provided short-term benefits but ultimately did not deliver enough consistent and predictable revenue to overcome its operational complexity and costs.&#34;</p><p>The <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/avelo-tiny-low-cost-airline-expanding-new-cities-list-2024-4\">airline</a> began operating these deportation flights in May but received significant backlash from travelers and faced protests at airports like Albany, Burbank, and New Haven, Connecticut.

GlobalX, for example, said its five-year contract awarded in 2024 is expected to generate roughly $65 million in annual revenue.</p><p>But activists said Avelo&#39;s involvement reflects a broader shift in the deportation system, as it&#39;s unusual for scheduled commercial airlines like Avelo to dedicate aircraft and crews to ICE flights.</p><p>This focal point of criticism coincides with the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-immigration-workforce-deportations-migrants-economy-population-decline-2024-11\">broader expansion of deportation activity</a> under the Trump Administration that prompted ICE&#39;s need to enlist additional operators.</p><p>There were nearly 12,000 deportation, domestic shuttle, and other removal-related flights across operators between President Donald Trump&#39;s inauguration on January 20 and November 30, 2025, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Human Rights First.</p><p>The Avelo flights are also reportedly not meeting the expected safety standards. Avelo&#39;s flight attendant union said in a September <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://aveloafa.org/news/addressing-safety-concerns-ice-flights-management\">memo</a> to Avelo management that the cabin crew &#34;were discouraged or prohibited from performing safety checks and cabin walk-throughs required by the FAA.&#34;</p><p>It added that there weren&#39;t any aircraft modifications that would allow restrained passengers to evacuate during an emergency.</p><p>The <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/avelo-airlines-hiring-flight-attendants-deportation-flights-mesa-arizona-2025-4\">cabin crew working these ICE flights were specifically hired</a> for this role, as were pilots and mechanics.

The carrier also plans to exit its base at Bradley International Airport in Hartford, Connecticut, in January, axing routes to Montego Bay and Cancún. The airline cited revenue underperformance.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695ea3fe04eda4732f2ea604?format=jpeg\" height=\"1698\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Avelo&#39;s current route map.\"/><figcaption>Avelo&#39;s current East Coast-focused route map, according to its website.<p class=\"copyright\">Avelo Airlines</p></figcaption></figure><p>Further, Avelo is closing bases in Raleigh and Wilmington, North Carolina. It will instead focus its operations out of four core airports: New Haven, Connecticut; Wilmington, Delaware; Charlotte, North Carolina &mdash; operating out of the city&#39;s smaller Concord-Padgett Regional Airport &mdash; and Lakeland, Florida.</p><p>Avelo said it plans to open a base in McKinney, Texas, near Dallas, in late 2026.</p><p>This pivot reinforces the airline&#39;s strategy of connecting secondary airports to larger cities while still accessible to major metropolitan areas &mdash; for example, its Delaware base serves the Philadelphia region, and Lakeland sits between Orlando and Tampa.</p><p>&#34;These changes enable Avelo to focus on sustainably scaling five core bases in 2026 and to prepare the company for growth in the coming years, facilitated by the company&#39;s recent order for up to 100 Embraer 195-E2 aircraft,&#34; the company said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/avelo-wont-operate-deportation-flights-for-ice-anymore-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

That marked a significant jump from the prior year, when the bank advised on roughly $707 billion in deals across 368 mergers or acquisitions.</p><p>Across Wall Street, headhunters and investment bankers have told Business Insider in recent weeks that they expect 2026 to generate robust activity in mergers and the capital markets. That backdrop may help explain why 48% of Morgan Stanley&#39;s new managing directors came from its Institutional Securities Group, which advises corporate clients on IPOs, buyouts, and sales.</p><p>The bank informed the newly elevated executives on Wednesday and is expected to release the full list of names publicly in the coming days.

The Air Force said the fighter was separated from a group during a nighttime training session after the jets entered cloud cover.</p><p>The F-16 suddenly descended quickly. Its altitude was just 1,700 feet when radar contact was lost. Taiwan&#39;s Ministry of Defense has identified the missing pilot as Capt. Hsin Po-yi. Officials remain unsure whether Hsin successfully ejected from the aircraft, although he had indicated he would eject seconds before the aircraft disappeared. It&#39;s unclear if he did.</p><p>In the days since the incident, a search and rescue mission has been ongoing in the waters off Hualien County. Multiple aircraft and vessels have been involved in the mission, but tall waves and strong winds have been complicating the search for the jet and Hsin.</p><p>Air Force officials told reporters during a press conference on Wednesday that there appeared to be a malfunction of the F-16&#39;s main onboard computer in which the aircraft&#39;s flight path was no longer displayed.</p><p>Now, Taiwanese air force officials have grounded all of <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-equipping-taiwan-f-16-agm-154-bombs-2024-2\">Taiwan&#39;s F-16 fleet</a> for inspections, and training missions have been temporarily suspended. Taiwan currently has about 140 F-16s, the older A/B models, that it has upgraded in recent years. It is expected to receive a batch of the newer F-16V or Viper jets in the coming years to add to its fleet.</p><p>The F-16 is made by American defense giant Lockheed Martin. Though it&#39;s been flying for over 50 years, it still represents a highly capable fourth-generation jet. The newest operator of the aircraft is Ukraine, which received a limited number from NATO partner nations.</p><p>This crash involving the Taiwanese military follows a similar incident that occurred in January 2022, when a Taiwanese F-16 went down off the island&#39;s west coast while taking part in training exercises. At the time, the F-16 went missing after taking off from Chiayi Air Base in southern Taiwan. In response, Taiwan suspended its combat training for the fleet.</p><p>It&#39;s not uncommon to see fleets grounded after accidents, especially if the cause is unclear. The US military has done this regularly.</p><p>Taiwan&#39;s Air Force has been strained in recent years by constant scrambling to track Chinese military aircraft, which regularly fly into the country&#39;s air defense identification zone.

About 2 million people receive military retirement benefits in the US. Some retired military leaders have been <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/william-mcraven-against-trump-navy-seal-presidency-2019-10\">strident critics</a> of President Donald Trump.</p><p>The defense secretary announced the decision to review Kelly, a retired Navy captain and astronaut who represents Arizona, for a reduction in his retired grade and pay on Monday, saying the senator&#39;s public statements, including a video in which he told US troops not to follow <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/us-showed-deadly-war-on-terror-tactics-striking-cartel-boat-2025-9\">illegal orders</a>, amount to sedition.

This Censure is a necessary process step, and will be placed in Captain Kelly&#39;s official and permanent military personnel file.&#34;</p><p>Don C. King, a retired Navy judge advocate general who now owns the King Military Law firm, said the fact that the statement was posted by Hegseth on X is &#34;very unusual&#34; and ensures the actions against Kelly are well publicized. &#34;I&#39;ve never seen that happen before.&#34;</p><p>Hegseth&#39;s public comments could give Kelly grounds to argue that the grade determination board, made up of military officers, is predisposed to punish the misconduct that the defense secretary alleged and in the way he suggested it.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/69389d137ecd1d1da6633c46?format=jpeg\" height=\"1333\" width=\"2000\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth recently accused Sen.

It nonetheless has profound implications for serving officers, whose careers can be marred or effectively ended for having lost their superior&#39;s confidence.</p><p>Hegseth called Kelly&#39;s comments seditious in the Monday X post: &#34;This conduct was seditious in nature and violated Articles 133 and 134 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, to which Captain Kelly remains subject as a retired officer receiving pay.&#34;</p><p>Hegseth cited 10 U.S.C. § 1370(f), a subsection of the Title 10 Armed Forces law, in his decision. Per federal code, military officers are retired in the highest rank &#34;served satisfactorily,&#34; and that determines the officer&#39;s pension. By law, officer grade determination is based on the officer&#39;s conduct while on active duty, not post-retirement.</p><p>The code establishes the reconsideration of an officer&#39;s retirement rank as possible under only four reasons. The first is if their rank was procured by fraud. The second is based on whether substantial evidence for revisiting retirement rank comes out afterward, but that&#39;s contemplating actions that occurred while the person was on active duty. The third is if a mistake was made in determining the retired grade. None of those applies to Kelly&#39;s case.</p><p>The fourth, which experts believe is what Hegseth is referring to, is if the defense secretary determines &#34;that good cause exists to reopen the determination of retired grade.&#34;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/694d846704eda4732f2e2062?format=jpeg\" height=\"683\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Donald Trump disembarks Air Force One in Palm Beach.\"/><figcaption>PALM BEACH, FLORIDA - DECEMBER 20: U.S. President Donald Trump walks off Air Force One at Palm Beach International Airport on December 20, 2025 in Palm Beach, Florida.

It would be a &#34;strong sign&#34; for the speech rights of service members, Maurer told BI. Kelly may also have additional protections as an elected federal lawmaker under the Constitution&#39;s speech and debate clause.</p><p>Kelly, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, made comments in the video released before new allegations emerged in late November about the US military&#39;s move to fire a missile at a boat it had already struck. The Pentagon&#39;s <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/pentagons-laws-of-war-says-shipwrecked-fighters-cant-be-killed-2025-12\">law of war manual</a> calls an attack on shipwreck survivors illegal.</p><p>Now, Kelly has 30 days to submit a response to the proceedings. In a public statement online, the senator said he&#39;d fight back and added: &#34;<a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/hegseth-had-system-installed-for-personal-cell-in-pentagon-office-2025-12\">Pete Hegseth</a> wants to send the message to every single retired service member that if they say something he or Donald Trump doesn&#39;t like, they will come after them the same way.&#34;</p><p>That appears to be a consequence of this, Maurer said, which he called &#34;a chilling effect on retired officers, especially senior-ranking&#34; ones.</p><p>Kelly&#39;s unusual case comes against the backdrop of a broader crackdown on what <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/military-troops-self-censorship-pentagon-crackdown-political-speech-2025-12\">military personnel say and post</a>, especially regarding the US&#39; strikes on alleged drug trafficking boats in the Caribbean, progressive politics, and the murder of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

If they&#39;re worth substantially less than that, Paramount&#39;s price of $30 per share for the whole business may look more attractive.</p><p>Ironically, this gives Paramount the incentive to talk down the value of the TV networks it&#39;s trying to buy, while it could be advantageous for Netflix to laud assets it doesn&#39;t want.</p><p>In its Wednesday rejection letter, WBD pointed to an added wrinkle. WBD said that Paramount&#39;s bid had added costs, including a $2.8 billion breakup fee payable to Netflix if WBD changed course, a $1.5 billion cost to lenders if it doesn&#39;t complete a debt exchange, and about $350 million in additional financing costs. That $4.7 billion sum would take about $1.79 per share away from Paramount&#39;s price, WBD said.</p><p>Media analysts have a range of views on the value of WBD&#39;s &#34;Global Networks&#34; division, but several have cited the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/msnbc-preps-live-events-expansion-versant-spinoff-2025-9\">new cable company Versant,</a> which began trading Monday, as a comparison.</p><p>In the three days since its public debut, Versant has lost about a quarter of its value. Shares are down to about $33.80 from a starting point of $45.17. Worth noting: One possible factor that could be impacting the sell-off is that some large funds that own Comcast shares can&#39;t own Versant and were thus forced to sell it.</p><p>Versant&#39;s market value is now under $5 billion, making its enterprise value roughly $7.25 billion, after including $2.25 billion in net debt. The media company told investors it expects to generate $1.85 billion to $2 billion in EBITDA, a common profitability metric, in 2026.</p><p>That means Versant&#39;s EV/EBITDA ratio &mdash;&nbsp;meaning equity and debt, divided by this year&#39;s adjusted earnings estimate &mdash; is about 3.8x. That&#39;s far lower than the high-single-digit or low-double-digit EV/EBITDA multiple that many S&amp;P 500 companies are valued at.</p><p>Versant&#39;s low valuation suggests that the market lacks appetite for cable TV assets, which is an ominous sign for the potential future of WBD&#39;s cable networks, including CNN, TNT, and HGTV.</p><p>If WBD&#39;s Global Networks traded at the same 3.8x EV/EBITDA ratio that Versant has, it would be worth only about $1.20 per share, based on MoffettNathanson&#39;s estimate for $4.8 billion in 2026 EBITDA.</p><p>A $1.20-per-share valuation for WBD&#39;s Global Networks would bolster Paramount&#39;s case to WBD shareholders (though it wouldn&#39;t necessarily mean the current offer is better than Netflix&#39;s, given the added costs WBD&#39;s board pointed to). A person familiar with Paramount&#39;s thinking said the company&#39;s estimated value for WBD&#39;s cable networks is even lower, at $0.56 per share.</p><p>MoffettNathanson valued WBD&#39;s Global Networks at $3.51 per share in a mid-December note.</p><h2 id=\"13a85665-b6b8-4f8c-bdf4-f0e55a34bf39\" data-toc-id=\"13a85665-b6b8-4f8c-bdf4-f0e55a34bf39\">Apples to apples, or apples to oranges?</h2><p>Ellison and company shouldn&#39;t celebrate yet.</p><p>Versant and WBD&#39;s Global Networks aren&#39;t necessarily an apples-to-apples comparison, even though they both own cable networks and have a substantial mix of live sports and news. Many analysts see WBD&#39;s portfolio &mdash; which includes CNN and major live sports rights like the NHL, college football, and &#34;March Madness&#34; college basketball &mdash; as more valuable than Versant&#39;s asset mix, which includes MS NOW and broadcast rights for the Premier League and the PGA Tour. However, WBD&#39;s Global Networks is set to carry far more debt than Versant, at $15 billion versus $2.25 billion.</p><p>WBD downplayed the similarities between Versant and its cable networks in its latest shareholder letter, saying that its business &#34;has greater scale and profits, with a geographically diversified footprint and strong international presence,&#34; including CNN. It also said the streaming service Discovery+, which is included in that division, &#34;generates substantial revenue.&#34;</p><p>Analyst Rich Greenfield of Lightshed Partners said in a Wednesday note that WBD&#39;s cable assets are far more valuable than Versant&#39;s.</p><p>Greenfield said he expects WBD&#39;s Global Networks to be &#34;sold and/or broken up after it spins out,&#34; which he believes would unlock &#34;significant value that far exceeds where the stock would trade as a stand-alone public company.&#34;</p><p>If Paramount can&#39;t convince shareholders that its $30-per-share offer is more valuable and less risky than Netflix&#39;s arrangement, Ellison could always raise his bid and force Netflix to match.</p><p>Greenfield thinks a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/warner-bros-paramount-netflix-kevin-mayer-former-top-disney-dealmaker-2025-12\">bidding war</a> could break out.</p><p>&#34;There is still a path for Paramount to outbid Netflix with a substantially higher bid, but it will require an overhaul of their current bid, and a dramatic increase in the cash invested from the Ellison family and/or their friends and financing partners,&#34; he wrote.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/paramount-david-ellison-wbd-warner-bros-discovery-versant-stock-struggles-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Visually, she describes it as standing on a ledge, stepping off, sinking briefly, and then rising far higher than where you started &mdash; just like the shape of the letter J.</p><p>The concept, which she has also written about in her <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://mollyg.substack.com/p/j-curve?utm_source=publication-search\">Lessons</a> Substack, challenges the idea of a steady career ladder that steadily moves up and to the right.</p><p>Instead of climbing rung by rung with promotions every two to five years, Graham argues that some of the most valuable professional growth comes from jumping into roles you aren&#39;t ready for and surviving any setbacks.</p><p>Graham&#39;s own J-curve began when billionaire investor and &#34;All-in&#34; podcast host Chamath Palihapitiya, then Facebook&#39;s vice president of growth, recruited her to help develop a smartphone, encouraging her to make the move by sketching out the J-shaped trajectory on a whiteboard.</p><p>He brought her on despite her having no experience in product development, dropping her into rooms filled with engineers and phone specialists with deep subject matter expertise. She recalled feeling like an &#34;idiot&#34; for much of her first six months.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695d7469832e0ef1ead747b4?format=jpeg\" height=\"4991\" width=\"3993\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Headshot of Molly Graham, the former Facebook and Google executive, and writer of the Lessons Substack\"/><figcaption>Headshot of Molly Graham, the former Facebook and Google executive, and writer of the Lessons Substack<p class=\"copyright\">Molly Graham</p></figcaption></figure><p>At her midyear review, Palihapitiya delivered what Graham called the worst performance evaluation she had ever received. But the new experience eventually expanded her expertise.</p><p>&#34;Slowly, I remember I had been doing all these trips to Taiwan because we were actually working on hardware and I, at some point, came back from Taiwan and I like drew on a whiteboard for him the layout of a mobile phone, trying to explain to him kind of like why something he wanted to do was not possible,&#34; Graham said. &#34;And I so vividly remember walking out of that meeting being like, &#39;Oh like I actually know things.&#39; And slowly then over the following three years I became an expert in mobile.&#34;</p><p>Palihapitiya did not respond to Business Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>&#34;The phone itself was a giant failure &mdash; a massive, costly failure for Facebook,&#34; Graham told Rachitsky on the podcast. &#34;But it was not a failure for me.&#34;</p><p>She credits the experience with teaching her that she could operate far outside her comfort zone &mdash; a lesson that later helped her take on senior leadership roles, including serving as COO of Quip, which Salesforce acquired for $750 million, and overseeing operations at the $7.4 billion Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.</p><p>The J-curve, Graham said, is especially common at fast-moving companies like Meta, Alphabet, Nvidia, and SpaceX, where leaders value employees who are willing to take big risks early and learn quickly. In those environments, proving adaptability can matter more than checking every qualification box.</p><p>Not everyone supported Graham&#39;s decision at the time. She said Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg, then the number two at the tech giant, advised against the move &mdash; as did her father.</p><p>&#34;When wiser, more experienced people questioned the job offer, it definitely made me pause,&#34; Graham told Business Insider in a follow-up email. &#34;But my gut felt really strongly that I needed to take the risk.&#34;</p><p>That instinct, she said, ultimately helped her discover what kind of work she didn&#39;t want to do, and where her strengths lay. She didn&#39;t want to sift through mock ups of hardware design and argue about a button&#39;s placement. Instead, she sharpened her management skills and prepared to help lead large organizations.</p><p>&#34;The much more fun careers are like jumping off cliffs,&#34; Graham told Rachitsky. &#34;They can take you to places that you never could have imagined.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/molly-graham-j-shape-career-path-facebook-chamath-palihapitiya-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Maybe it&#39;s a cold. Maybe I have the flu. Maybe this is just me getting used to college food. Or maybe I just got punched in the stomach a few too many times.</p><p>I was a 19-year-old freshman running back at West Virginia Wesleyan College.

My friends and I were home messing around, cracking jokes, and jumping on the scale to see who&#39;d lost and gained weight since college started. I stepped on the scale, and it registered 155 pounds. I had lost 30 pounds in half a year. That&#39;s when my dad called the doctor and made sure I got an appointment the next day.</p><p>After a few visits, doctors discovered I was bleeding internally, and I was sent to the hospital for tests, including a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-symptoms-in-my-30s-colonoscopy-cost-insurance-2025-7\">colonoscopy</a>.

Things that weren&#39;t easy to me anymore included getting up, using the toilet, or having the ability to just move around the way I used to.</p><p>On top of that, I was outfitted with a port for chemotherapy infusions, lost my hair, and dealt with how those toxic treatments completely sap your energy.</p><p>And yet, even after all the treatment was over, doctors were still finding more cancer in my body. They did one more major surgery, put in another temporary colostomy bag, and tried a new kind of chemotherapy. Six more months of treatment. The cancer still wasn&#39;t eradicated. At this point in time, I&#39;d done two major surgeries and 12 rounds of chemo, and the doctors were still telling me, &#34;Well, we have to do another surgery and a different type of chemo.&#34;</p><p>My faith in my oncologist was waning, my frustration mounting. I&#39;m thinking: <em>You keep telling me if I do these things, I&#39;m going to be all right, and it&#39;s going to be gone, but it&#39;s the same cycle over and over again</em>. I was starting to feel like a test patient.</p><p>That&#39;s when, with some help from my football coaches, I sought a second opinion out of state. Finally, I was tested for <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-years-of-stomach-pain-diagnosed-colon-cancer-2025-5\">Lynch syndrome</a>, the genetic condition sometimes called &#34;cancer family syndrome&#34; or &#34;hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer&#34; because of how it predisposes people to several kinds of cancers, but especially colon cancer, usually in their 40s and 50s.</p><p>Once I had my proper diagnosis, the disease became easier to treat. Oncologists have recently discovered how well Lynch syndrome responds to immunotherapy, where you recruit your own immune system to recognize and fight cancer, sometimes without any need for toxic radiation or chemotherapy.</p><p>I went back to my doctor again, who agreed to take a different approach and do immunotherapy this time, with no chemo required. The difference was amazing. Instead of lying in bed all day, exhausted, I was able to live a relatively normal life during this round of treatment. I wouldn&#39;t say my energy was 100%, but maybe 80%, which is a really major improvement from life during chemo.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695d597864858d02d217d818?format=jpeg\" height=\"668\" width=\"580\" charset=\"\" alt=\"khalil with his &#39;smith strong&#39; shirt on in the hospital - at a lower weight\"/><figcaption>Smith lost 30 pounds before he was diagnosed with advanced-stage colon cancer.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Khalil Smith</p></figcaption></figure><p>I not only felt better, but I was also getting better. Doctors were able to stop my immunotherapy treatments completely in mid-2024, and I&#39;ve been all clear since then.</p><p>I still get scans about every three months. I know I&#39;ll have to be vigilant; my condition puts me at a lifelong higher risk of developing cancer because the mutations that are built into my DNA make it easier for the disease to sprout up.</p><p>School was my much-needed dose of normalcy through all of the cancer treatment. I told myself I was still going to graduate on time, even if I couldn&#39;t be an athlete. My doctors suggested taking a break to heal, and while I understood where they were coming from, I just knew for my own mental health I had to maintain at least some of the &#34;normal&#34; things in life while I was a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/young-ceo-with-colon-cancer-leadership-lessons-2025-12\">cancer patient</a>. It helped me stay motivated, knowing that at least I could still graduate on time, even if I couldn&#39;t play football.</p><p>I also kept on working out, getting in <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/exercise-can-prevent-recurrent-colon-cancer-study-2025-6\">regular exercise</a> throughout my treatments. Even when I was getting chemotherapy infusions, I&#39;d strap on a bag to let the chemo drip into me while I moved around, and head to the track for three to five miles of walking. Some days I could only walk very slowly, others it was a brisk pace, depending on my energy. I think the movement really helped manage the side effects, making them milder. Even though I did have some symptoms, and chemo was rough, I felt like keeping my body active and getting that blood flowing and moving around was so beneficial.</p><h2 id=\"eee6736a-43bb-49bb-a57b-0e09fe778bb2\" data-toc-id=\"eee6736a-43bb-49bb-a57b-0e09fe778bb2\"><strong>I changed my workouts and eat less sugary cereal now</strong></h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695d59af04eda4732f2e913e?format=jpeg\" height=\"719\" width=\"556\" charset=\"\" alt=\"khalil brand\"/><figcaption>Smith returned to football his senior year, but his body wasn&#39;t the same, especially his hands and his feet.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Khalil Smith</p></figcaption></figure><p>After two years off the field, with a clean bill of health, I returned to the football team my senior year. It felt good to be back on the field, but my body was not the same anymore.</p><p>I have issues with <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/father-peripheral-neuropathy-nerve-damage-condition-navigating-fatherhood-work-health-2025-10\">neuropathy</a>, a type of treatment-related nerve damage that makes my hands and feet tingle and go numb. This makes me hyper-sensitive to cold temperatures, making it hard to drive a car when it&#39;s cold out or even open up the freezer and pull something out. It&#39;s kind of hard to catch a football when you can&#39;t really feel your hands, or run when your feet are numb. Eventually, I decided it was time to quit the sport I love, but it felt good doing it on my own terms, and playing for one last season.</p><p>I still work out almost every day, but it&#39;s not the same as having a team sport. I&#39;ve started some <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/woman-colon-cancer-misdiagnosed-ibs-hemorrhoid-2025-3\">personal training</a>, training people who were inspired by how well I recovered and how much <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/scientists-test-low-carb-for-breast-cancer-treatment-chemotherapy-2024-9\">muscle</a> I was able to build back after my treatments.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695c16c5832e0ef1ead72d72?format=jpeg\" height=\"533\" width=\"800\" charset=\"\" alt=\"khalil graduating on time\"/><figcaption>Smith graduated on time with a degree in exercise science.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Khalil Smith</p></figcaption></figure><p>I have also changed my <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/colon-cancer-doctors-give-diet-advice-best-and-worst-foods-for-cancer-2025-6\">diet</a>. After living with a colostomy bag a few times and seeing exactly what comes out of your body after you eat, you start to think about food differently. Some of that stuff is not being digested at all, especially the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fda-bans-red-no-3-food-dye-2025-1\">artificial colors</a> in brightly colored cereals. I don&#39;t eat as much junk food or cereal as I used to, in part because seeing those bright blue, purple, and green colors coming out of my body scared me straight. I try to stick to a diet that&#39;s good for muscle building and longevity, mainly focusing on lean proteins like <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vegetarians-fish-or-meat-for-brain-health-blue-zone-doctor-2024-9\">chicken and fish</a>, plus lots of leafy <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/why-salad-greens-are-good-for-brain-health-aging-2024-7\">greens</a>, with room for a little bit of red meat now and then to keep my iron levels up, but not as much as I used to eat.</p><p>I hope my story can be helpful to others going through cancer treatment. I have run a few clothing drives, and donate to my local hospital just so cancer patients like me can have snacks and blankets, comfortable stuff while they&#39;re waiting around.</p><p>I know how it can feel when your family is going through such a hard time. It&#39;s always good to have somebody see you, someone who has experienced it, to help you get through a tough time.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/college-football-player-stabbing-stomach-pain-stage-4-colon-cancer-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

He said he knew he would be managing data scientists and programmers, and wanted to better understand their perspective. However, since earning his degree in 2020, software development has &#34;completely changed.&#34;</p><p>&#34;You&#39;ve got to always be learning and challenging yourself to learn every single day,&#34; Depa said.</p><p>To stay current on topics like AI, he said he listens to podcasts and reads articles about the latest news.</p><p>Depa isn&#39;t the only leader who carves out regular time for learning new things. <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/visa-exec-shares-productivity-hack-4-hours-weekly-studying-2025-12\">Visa&#39;s Oliver Jenkyn</a> recently told Business Insider that he blocks off four hours a week to study a topic he wants to understand, like the technology of stablecoins or the history of the semiconductor industry.</p><h2 id=\"74f4e838-a729-42e7-8583-30d515d93026\" data-toc-id=\"74f4e838-a729-42e7-8583-30d515d93026\">No. 2: Learn from others</h2><p>Depa said that, in addition to allocating time for<strong> </strong>individual learning, it&#39;s &#34;critical&#34; to lean on personal mentors.</p><p>&#34;All of us should have our own personal advisors &mdash; mentors around us that we can call,&#34; Depa said.</p><p>The executive pointed to EY&#39;s global AI advisory <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_gl/newsroom/2024/10/ey-establishes-ey-ai-global-ai-advisory-council-to-guide-ai-strategy-and-adapt-to-fast-paced-technological-and-market-changes\">council</a>, which includes 20 top AI leaders who assist the firm in navigating the AI landscape. The council meets and provides feedback on different plans, Depa said.</p><p>&#34;It&#39;s a really nice forum for me to test what&#39;s coming next,&#34; Depa said.</p><p>The global chief innovation officer said that having a council of opinions helps him challenge his thinking, but soliciting input from others doesn&#39;t have to be so formal. Having relationships with people with who you can check in with to get different perspectives is &#34;increasingly important,&#34; he said.</p><h2 id=\"92933661-282e-461d-9c38-36cff2a546c6\" data-toc-id=\"92933661-282e-461d-9c38-36cff2a546c6\">No. 3: Apply what you learn</h2><p id=\"92933661-282e-461d-9c38-36cff2a546c6\">Depa said that while education and learning from others are important, it&#39;s necessary to actually implement those teachings. That could mean vibe coding or creating an application.</p><p id=\"92933661-282e-461d-9c38-36cff2a546c6\">&#34;That whole learning experience is going to really help create new brain dynamics for you to learn the next thing and the next thing,&#34; Depa said.</p><p id=\"92933661-282e-461d-9c38-36cff2a546c6\">Depa said failure is a natural part of experimenting with tools and putting new ideas to practice. Getting comfortable with that discomfort, he added, helps build a mindset focused on challenging yourself and learning more.</p><p id=\"2b0c7039-000a-4c4a-b26e-85bb6e8c028b\">&#34;If you do it enough times, your brain will start to appreciate that process of formal learning, having a team of advisors, and then applying it and learning and growing,&#34; Depa said.</p><p id=\"2b0c7039-000a-4c4a-b26e-85bb6e8c028b\"><a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/blackstone-cto-explains-daily-weekly-upskilling-routine-2025-12\">Blackstone CTO John Stecher</a> also emphasized the importance of being hands-on with technology in a recent interview with Business Insider.

I&#39;m lucky &mdash; I get a home-cooked meal almost every night. That&#39;s also why I have to weigh myself every morning before I exercise or drink anything. I also <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/oura-ring-4-review\">track my sleep</a> and stress using an Oura Ring.</p><p>Within about 45 minutes of waking up, I work out at home using my Peloton and Tonal. Five days a week, I do 30 minutes of cardio and 15 minutes of strength training.</p><p>Afterward, I meditate for about 10 minutes using Henry Shukman&#39;s app, The Way.</p><p>By around 7:15 a.m., I&#39;m in the shower and getting ready. Once I&#39;m dressed, I spend a little time with my dog, London, before heading outside.</p><p>I travel a lot, but for three days, I work from home. At my home in Marin County, I work from a small pod, a 110-square-foot room in my backyard &mdash; made in Canada &mdash; that is my private workspace. I&#39;m a nature person, and being surrounded by grass and trees is like getting plugged into an energy source.</p><p>I also have a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-money-rto-real-estate-boom-san-francisco-2025-9\">condo in San Francisco</a>, which I go back and forth between.</p><p>Before I start work, I make a coffee with two regular shots and two decaf and bring it with me, along with water.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/69557c2064858d02d2179cf7?format=jpeg\" height=\"1152\" width=\"1536\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Amy Errett&#39;s pod.\"/><figcaption>Errett works out of a pod in her home&#39;s backyard in Marin County.<p class=\"copyright\">SolComms</p></figcaption></figure><h2 id=\"b1fb5141-fe58-4bfa-8ced-8ec99cd9a8ac\" data-toc-id=\"b1fb5141-fe58-4bfa-8ced-8ec99cd9a8ac\">From 7:30 a.m. to noon, I&#39;m in back-to-back meetings.</h2><p id=\"b1fb5141-fe58-4bfa-8ced-8ec99cd9a8ac\">My workdays are highly structured. I have weekly one-on-one meetings with everyone who reports directly to me, always at the same time each week. Those blocks are fixed, and everything else gets scheduled around them.</p><p>My assistant, Christina, is essential to keeping my schedule running. We meet three times a week and plan weeks in advance.</p><p>My meetings include internal check-ins, conversations with the PR team, and external meetings. I also mentor other women investors. I&#39;ve been on the board of my&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-elite-business-schools-wharton-overhauling-curriculum-2025-11\">alma mater, Wharton,</a>&nbsp;so there are sometimes external board meetings, and my own board meetings.</p><p>I also personally interview every hire at the level of store general manager or above for 15 minutes before they receive an offer.</p><p>These interviews are focused entirely on cultural fit. I always ask one question: &#34;Tell me about something that didn&#39;t go well in your life, and what you learned from it.&#34;</p><p>I&#39;m looking for resilience, grit, honesty, love, and passion. Some of the answers I hear &mdash; about loss, hardship, or perseverance &mdash; stop me in my tracks and tell me who someone really is. I&#39;ve had people tell me they are homeless and worked their way up to being a general manager somewhere else. That 15-minute process adds up, but it&#39;s incredibly important to me.</p><h2 id=\"ef029700-65d6-40e0-bfde-4e6aaab49e4e\" data-toc-id=\"ef029700-65d6-40e0-bfde-4e6aaab49e4e\">I have a block at lunch that I can actually eat &mdash; and breathe.</h2><p id=\"ef029700-65d6-40e0-bfde-4e6aaab49e4e\">I&#39;m a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/25-year-old-founder-high-protein-smoothie-gut-health-2025-12\">protein loader</a>, especially since losing a significant amount of weight. I aim to eat about 90 to 100 grams of protein a day. Cottage cheese is my best friend &mdash; it&#39;s high in protein, relatively low in calories, and keeps me full.</p><p>My go-to meal is a bowl of cottage cheese topped with a poached egg and a slice of gluten-free toast. I also allow myself one small indulgence: three days a week, I have a mini Coke Zero in the afternoon.</p><h2 id=\"559dda89-3b66-4008-9dd3-197a5377878d\" data-toc-id=\"559dda89-3b66-4008-9dd3-197a5377878d\">The afternoon goes hard.</h2><p id=\"47473bae-69d3-46b9-b4ec-d7515be94d24\">I&#39;ve tried to work with my assistant to carve out blocks of uninterrupted thinking time, but the truth is, I don&#39;t get much of it.</p><p id=\"47473bae-69d3-46b9-b4ec-d7515be94d24\">Most days are packed back-to-back. I do, however, protect Fridays: I don&#39;t take meetings after 1 p.m., and that&#39;s when I catch up and think more freely.</p><p id=\"47473bae-69d3-46b9-b4ec-d7515be94d24\">My best thinking happens outside. I live near Marin, so I hike often.</p><p id=\"47473bae-69d3-46b9-b4ec-d7515be94d24\">On Fridays, I&#39;ll often leave right at 1 p.m. and drive to <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/living-on-a-boat-cheaper-than-land-2025-10\">my boat</a> alone. I don&#39;t talk to anyone &mdash; I just cruise, sit with my thoughts, and enjoy the scenery. Sometimes a close friend will join me, but most of the time it&#39;s solo.</p><p id=\"47473bae-69d3-46b9-b4ec-d7515be94d24\">During the rest of the week, though, I&#39;m extremely disciplined about communication.</p><p id=\"47473bae-69d3-46b9-b4ec-d7515be94d24\">My inbox is always at zero, and I respond quickly across email, Slack, text, and phone. I actually like calling people, even though most people don&#39;t &mdash; I think there&#39;s a lost art in <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-phone-ansewring-hello-2025-7\">picking up the phone</a> and having a real conversation.</p><p id=\"47473bae-69d3-46b9-b4ec-d7515be94d24\">It&#39;s not always easy to stay on track &mdash; especially with such a tight schedule.</p><p id=\"47473bae-69d3-46b9-b4ec-d7515be94d24\">This work is personal to me. I&#39;m putting my energy into it, and so are more than 1,100 other people. When something doesn&#39;t feel good &mdash; we didn&#39;t do right by someone, or we got turned down &mdash; I feel it deeply.</p><p>I&#39;ve gotten better at handling those moments over time. I work with an <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/career-coach-to-top-executives-author-erin-coupe-excerpt-2025-11\">executive coach</a> over Zoom twice a week.

ChatGPT traffic is up 49.5%; Gemini&#39;s traffic is up 563.6%, per Similarweb.</p><p>ChatGPT still has a healthy lead. In December, ChatGPT attracted 5.5 billion visitors, according to Similarweb.

It was more <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/google-gemini-3-release-features-launch-ai-model-coding-chatgpt-2025-11\">visual and creative</a> than previous iterations, and was better at coding.</p><p>Google has also flexed its primary advantage over OpenAI: the ability to integrate its AI within its highly used <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gemini-3-google-openai-advantage-full-stack-chatgpt-2025-11\">search products</a>.

I was testing a voice app I had written. If I said the phrase just right, the app would respond. If not, I would tweak the code and try again.</p><p>I had just <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/youtubers-coding-skills-break-into-software-development-2022-3\">learned to code from YouTube</a>. My apps were getting downloads, and I was addicted. I would run home from school, drop my backpack, and open the reviews before starting my homework. It was the first time I saw that code written alone in my bedroom could reach people I would never meet.</p><p>After studying engineering and business at UC, Berkeley, and spending nearly two years working at Meta, I&#39;m now running <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.myaifrontdesk.com/\">Frontdesk</a>, an AI startup that helps businesses automate millions of conversations with AI.</p><h2 id=\"529e066d-c3c0-4c4e-800b-2b91bc5989eb\" data-toc-id=\"529e066d-c3c0-4c4e-800b-2b91bc5989eb\"><strong>When I was starting out, I realized code could protect people</strong></h2><p>My early programming projects were playful. I built a text-to-speech app and a speech-to-text app. Then, one of my relatives slipped and fell at home. He was yelling for help, but nobody was home, and his phone was out of reach. If his phone had been able to hear him, it could&#39;ve brought him help immediately.</p><p>In 2016, I developed Rescuer, a voice app that enabled users to trigger an alarm by shouting a secret phrase, automatically sending their location, photos, and audio to designated emergency contacts.</p><p>Rescuer earned recognition from political officials and the press. What mattered more was that I learned that code written from my bedroom could help someone. From then on, I began building for real impact.</p><p>I started answering questions on coding forums, recording YouTube coding tutorials, and writing for an engineering blog. Over time, my answers on forums like <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stack-overflow-crisis-future-of-online-data-ai-world-2023-7\">Stack Overflow</a> reached millions of developers, which only deepened my passion for continuous learning.</p><h2 id=\"1c399450-107d-433f-8c79-7c1ced6f689b\" data-toc-id=\"1c399450-107d-433f-8c79-7c1ced6f689b\"><strong>Living in two worlds</strong></h2><p>There was still one thing I couldn&#39;t figure out, no matter how many downloads my apps received. I didn&#39;t know how to turn an app into a real business. I didn&#39;t understand pricing, customers, or why some products became companies while others remained weekend projects.</p><p>As I was deciding where to attend college, I knew I wanted to learn about the business side.</p><p>I chose UC Berkeley&#39;s M.E.T. program because I could study both engineering and business. I graduated with an EECS (electrical engineering &amp; computer science) and business degree in three years.</p><h2 id=\"de44f0ac-c47a-422c-9e64-09931818000a\" data-toc-id=\"de44f0ac-c47a-422c-9e64-09931818000a\"><strong>The experiment</strong></h2><p>In 2023, when ChatGPT had its big moment, I asked myself, <em>What if I could just talk to this thing on a real phone line?</em></p><p>Over a weekend, I hacked together one of the first prototypes that connected ChatGPT to a real phone number. I posted a short clip and a tweet, and it got a lot of attention.</p><p>The tech was not ready to be a real product. Latency was bad. Reliability was fragile. The models made strange errors. But that experiment planted a question in my mind that I could not shake: <em>If this ever became good enough, what would it look like to use it to help real businesses?</em></p><h2 id=\"540bc858-98d9-4c4d-9e71-d84b6428350f\" data-toc-id=\"540bc858-98d9-4c4d-9e71-d84b6428350f\"><strong>Leaving comfort</strong></h2><p>By graduation, I had offers to work in finance at Citadel or in <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/best-engineers-not-on-linkedin-former-meta-employee-2025-12\">engineering at Meta</a>. I&#39;d spent all of college living in both worlds, and I didn&#39;t want to pick just one side, but I chose Meta.</p><p>I shelved my phone experiment to join Meta. It was a dream setup. My team was incredibly supportive, I was learning how to build at a massive scale, and life was good &mdash; from the smart colleagues to the famous free food.</p><p>I was part of a fintech team where I&#39;d push one line of code, and millions of transactions would be affected. It felt less like a corporation and more like a high-growth startup; I was given incredible ownership from day one and learned more in almost two years than I expected to in five. The scale was exhilarating.</p><p>But I was spending all my time behind the code. The business side, the part I&#39;d learned to love at Berkeley, felt far away. As an engineer at a big company, there was no clear path back to the center.</p><h2 id=\"3511eea6-2a5c-4f7b-8e66-673e83d34c88\" data-toc-id=\"3511eea6-2a5c-4f7b-8e66-673e83d34c88\"><strong>I kept hearing about AI in the hallways</strong></h2><p>I wasn&#39;t working directly on AI, but I could sense the momentum building. Every few months, the models improved noticeably. My ChatGPT phone hack stopped feeling like a viral stunt and started to feel like a glimpse of the future.</p><p>After my post went viral in college, hundreds of businesses reached out, asking for a solution. I kept thinking about all those businesses, where a missed call meant a missed customer. I knew there was demand, I knew nobody was serving them, and I knew I wanted to be the one to build it.</p><p>Leaving wasn&#39;t easy. Meta was comfortable, offering an incredible salary, stock refreshers, and interesting problems. Everyone told me to stay another year, vest more equity, and build more credentials. The rational move was to wait.</p><p>I kept asking myself, <em>if I waited, would I regret it?</em> The window felt finite. Every month I stayed was a month these businesses were not being served.</p><h2 id=\"465a1063-4ee7-408f-ad6f-19ee2d33cc9d\" data-toc-id=\"465a1063-4ee7-408f-ad6f-19ee2d33cc9d\"><strong>I quit my job at Meta in February 2025 after 1 1/2 years at the company</strong></h2><p id=\"ee270c0d-3999-4104-99a3-0020c22c6891\">I raised capital, moved to NYC from California, and began building Frontdesk.<strong> </strong>I&#39;m now the founder and CEO.</p><p id=\"ee270c0d-3999-4104-99a3-0020c22c6891\">Frontdesk is a comprehensive AI operating system that engages with customers across all channels and performs real-world tasks, such as scheduling and follow-ups.</p><p>We work in-person in an office in SoHo. Most people in our office share a similar story to mine; they <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/lessons-learned-leaving-microsoft-start-own-company-2025-10\">left Microsoft</a>, Amazon, or Meta, walking away from good salaries and stock options, because they believed this was worth building.</p><p>I feel lucky to work with people who push me to be better every day.</p><h2 id=\"25b2293d-2f76-4b01-a217-cb6e1a2a8188\" data-toc-id=\"25b2293d-2f76-4b01-a217-cb6e1a2a8188\"><strong>Still pacing in my room</strong></h2><p>Most nights, my work looks the same as it did in middle school. I pace, talk into a phone, and listen for what feels off. The difference is that now, when it works, it works across millions of calls. It&#39;s the same instinct that led me to build Rescuer years ago.</p><p>The phones are still ringing, and the models are still getting better. I know where I want to be while that happens: close to the code and building something worth leaving comfort behind.</p><p><em>Did you quit a Big Tech job to build your own company?

At the same time, he said non-client-facing roles, which make up the other half of its workforce, have shrunk by about 25% while output from that side has grown 10%.</p><p>&#34;Our model has always been synonymous that growth only occurs with total head count growth. Now it&#39;s actually splitting. We can grow in this part, the client-facing side, and we can shrink in this part and have aggregate growth in total,&#34; he said. &#34;That&#39;s a new paradigm and a new dynamic.&#34;</p><p>Sternfels said the firm has seen massive productivity gains as it&#39;s embraced AI, saving 1.5 million hours in search and synthesis work last year alone. Instead of doing the work that&#39;s typically done by more junior employees, he said McKinsey consultants are &#34;moving up the stack&#34; and tackling more complicated problems.</p><p>McKinsey employees also have a brand new set of coworkers that are increasingly becoming an essential part of the company: AI agents, which can act independently like digital employees. Sternfels said that as of last week, the company had 40,000 human employees and 25,000 personalized agents. Sternfels said AI agents are able to handle entire job functions on their own.</p><p>He expects McKinsey to have about the same number of AI agents as human employees by the end of the year.</p><p>For young professionals coming into the workforce, Sternfels said they should think about honing skills that AI can&#39;t do, setting the right aspirations, human judgment, and true creativity.</p><p>Business Insider has previously reported on how AI is disrupting consulting and changing the ways firms like McKinsey make money, including by shifting to an <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ai-reshapes-how-mckinsey-makes-money-consultancy-025-11\">outcome-based pricing</a> model.</p><p>The workforce changes at McKinsey also reflect a broader challenge facing large, established companies as AI disrupts how we work.</p><p>&#34;This is about how do you transform incumbent entities into something different,&#34; he said at CES, adding that for large existing enterprises &#34;you have a choice &mdash; transform or die.&#34;</p><p>He added that companies are &#34;moving at literally warp speed now.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I haven&#39;t met a CEO yet that isn&#39;t talking about &#39;how do I get my organization moving faster,&#39;&#34; he&#39;s said. &#34;It&#39;s quite frankly less about strategy, it&#39;s more about organizational speed.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/mckinsey-chief-ai-cutting-adding-jobs-growth-ai-agents-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Removing Instagram from my phone (while still using my account on my desktop) sounds as dramatic as switching to skim milk.</p><p>But that app was a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-quit-social-media-anxiety-free-time-2024-3\">social lifeline</a>. It was where people announced their engagements, graduations, and pregnancies. It was how I tapped into what my friends (and friends of friends) were up to on a random Tuesday &mdash; a breezy conversational springboard. It assured I never fully lost touch with anyone: not with high school classmates, distant family members, or people I vaguely remembered meeting once at a party, long ago.</p><p>While I&#39;d waste fewer hours scrolling through painstakingly staged influencer weddings and overly simplified political infographics, I&#39;d also miss milestones and inside jokes. Recede too much, and I might lose entire connections.</p><p>In the end, it was the best decision I made last year &mdash; arguably, in many years. I became a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/i-tracked-moods-every-day-years-happiness-habits-2025-10\">significantly happier person</a>, and even the annoying parts of being a desktop-only Instagram user felt like perks.</p><h2 id=\"b0b9eb24-c157-4c46-bcc3-fad8267fc749\" data-toc-id=\"b0b9eb24-c157-4c46-bcc3-fad8267fc749\"><strong>No more phantom bad moods</strong></h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6945c5b004eda4732f2deac2?format=jpeg\" height=\"3120\" width=\"4160\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Woman with ice\"/><figcaption>I touched ice instead of grass. Close enough!<p class=\"copyright\">Julia Pugachevsky</p></figcaption></figure><p>At first, I&#39;d still compulsively tap into the &#34;social media&#34; folder on my phone, expecting to find that sunset-hued camera icon. After about a week, I adjusted to my new reality. Like a treat-deprived lab rat, I picked up my phone less.</p><p>What I called &#34;ghost emotions&#34; were gone. For the decade-plus I&#39;ve had <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/delete-social-media-shopping-apps-smartphone-anxiety-sleep-save-money-2024-3\">Instagram on my smartphone</a>, I was used to sleepwalking into the app, seeing an image that vaguely stirred some negative emotion in me (envy, annoyance, exclusion), and carrying the remnants of that feeling into whatever I was doing in the real world.</p><p>This lined up with what researchers have found: that, for some people, social media is linked to <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-use-irritability-study-2025-3\">higher irritability</a> and <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-social-media-use-linked-to-decline-mental-health\">declines in mental health</a>. These side effects can outweigh the positives, like staying more connected to friends.</p><p>Instagram declined to comment on this story.</p><p>Without the overload of information that didn&#39;t add anything to my life &mdash; and the nagging pressure to contribute to it &mdash; I felt like<strong> </strong>my brain was freer to enjoy other pursuits. I finished more books (and seemed to better process what I read). I busied my hands with crocheting instead of scrolling. <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/andrew-yang-no-phones-offline-party-nobile-mobile-experience-nyc-2025-9\">Parties became more fun</a> because I no longer mentally pre-rehearsed the photos I would take or the captions I would write.</p><h2 id=\"f4934441-a5fd-4b81-a6ca-aaffc7e36cc1\" data-toc-id=\"f4934441-a5fd-4b81-a6ca-aaffc7e36cc1\"><strong>I got creative with staying connected</strong></h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6945c53904eda4732f2deaaa?format=jpeg\" height=\"2268\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Cookies\"/><figcaption>I took more initiative in inviting friends over.<p class=\"copyright\">Julia Pugachevsky</p></figcaption></figure><p>There were some downsides to no longer having the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/appstinence-movement-tech-lovers-dumping-smartphones-age-of-dumb-phones-2025-5\">app on my phone</a>.</p><p>While I generally didn&#39;t miss the pressure to post, it was frustrating not to have that option on the desktop version. When someone posted my professional work, all I could do was &#34;like&#34; the post and move on instead of resharing it. And if I was tagged in a friend&#39;s story and didn&#39;t check within 24 hours, I had absolutely no idea what they said.</p><p>The biggest hurdle was remembering birthdays. I&#39;d grown used to depending on friends&#39; story announcements. Now, if I didn&#39;t want to look like an ice-cold jerk on everyone&#39;s special days, I had to get creative.</p><p>So, I set aside about an hour one day. For birthdays I didn&#39;t already have memorized, I combed through <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/inside-instagram-meme-empire-doing-things-strategy-dms-2025-5\">every DM on Instagram</a>, scrolling back to when I said &#34;happy birthday!&#34; and wrote every date into a Notes document on my phone.</p><p>Did I feel slightly unhinged? Yes. But I also know no one&#39;s ever been mad about you wishing them a happy birthday (though, perhaps a few in my circle were a little spooked).</p><p>I also pushed myself to get over my lifelong fear of reaching out first. If I wanted to feel social without social media, I&#39;d need to be a little more outgoing.</p><p>Sometimes, this meant writing down reminders to text people when I thought of them, but was too busy at the moment to reach out. Other times, I offered to host the next knitting club or <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/gen-z-women-forming-book-clubs-to-combat-loneliness-2024-3\">book club</a>, or took the initiative to coordinate group plans when I&#39;d usually wait for someone else to pick up the slack.</p><p>The social isolation I was so worried about never happened. If anything, I felt more social because I was prioritizing in-person interaction.</p><h2 id=\"dd74a341-b760-44b8-888b-82a075793cff\" data-toc-id=\"dd74a341-b760-44b8-888b-82a075793cff\"><strong>Embracing a more analog life</strong></h2><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/6945c4dc04eda4732f2dea9d?format=jpeg\" height=\"2268\" width=\"3024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Cat and crocheted yarn\"/><figcaption>I took up crocheting.<p class=\"copyright\">Julia Pugachevsky</p></figcaption></figure><p>Once I got a taste of how freeing being offline could be, I wanted to go a step further.</p><p>I hated how often I woke up (or stayed up late) reading the news. My insatiable need to always be in the know left me more scattered and irritable. So, I cut down on that, too. Halfway through the year, I bought a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/brick-gadget-helped-cut-down-my-phone-tiktok-habit-2025-2\">Brick device</a><strong> </strong>to block apps like my email or the internet on my phone.</p><p>Yes, sometimes, there are downsides. I&#39;ve missed (or been late to) big life updates from less-close friends. I&#39;ve drifted apart from a few others, with whom I shared mostly a meme-exchanging sort of friendship. While bittersweet, it has also helped me focus on fewer, closer friends than an unmanageably large network.</p><p>Now, I spend my mornings journaling, chatting longer with my husband, or actually making it to a workout without rushing out the door. Eventually, I check my <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/social-media-dead-instagram-tiktok-bereal-replaced-group-chats-messaging-2023-8\">Instagram DMs</a> the way I&#39;d peruse my email in the 2010s. I tap a heart, I laugh at a video, and I return to my life.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/instagram-user-for-a-year-deleted-social-media-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

It hasn&#39;t worked.</p><p>But the tech guys haven&#39;t given up. Their new pitch: Instead of buying bulky goggles that replace your reality with a computer-generated version of something else, what about some glasses?</p><p>You can see evidence of the switch-up with a couple of recent news stories:</p><ul><li>Apple is reportedly <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/ab817ba1-15ec-473f-b609-5b5016b3258d\">cutting production</a> of its expensive, heavy <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-vision-pro-store-lines-tim-cook-nyc-2024-2\">Apple Vision Pro</a> headsets, which went on sale two years ago but <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-vision-pro-meta-ray-ban-which-better-why-2025-10\">never seemed to find a market</a>.

IDC also says teched-up glasses shipments shot up by more than 200%, but that was from more or less a standing start.</li></ul><p>At first glance, this makes a bunch of sense: People don&#39;t wear big heavy stuff on their head unless they have to &mdash; like if they&#39;re skiing, perhaps. But lots of people wear glasses. So if the tech guys want to sell new tech, they should stop trying to make things people don&#39;t wear and focus on the things people already wear.</p><p>The reality is a little more complicated: Shrinking a computer &mdash; or even parts of a computer &mdash; into something that looks, feels, and weighs like glasses is incredibly hard. The lighter and cheaper you make them, the less they can do &mdash; which makes it harder to justify why you&#39;d wear them at all.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695d7f1164858d02d217de05?format=jpeg\" height=\"5171\" width=\"7757\" charset=\"\" alt=\"People in an Apple Store try on Apple Vision Pro headsets.\"/><figcaption>Apple Vision Pro headsets have been a tough sell.<p class=\"copyright\">Cheng Xin/Getty Images</p></figcaption></figure><p>So when Meta says it has been selling a ton of Ray-Ban Display Glasses, which start at $800 a pair, you need to put that in context: The company sold an <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.reutersconnect.com/all?id=tag%3Areuters.com%2C2026%3Anewsml_KBN3O1167%3A3&amp;search=all%3Ameta%20ray-ban\">estimated</a> 15,000 units in the last three months of 2025.</p><p>We are likely to get a much better sense of consumer demand for this stuff in the next couple years, as more competition arrives.</p><p><a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/android-show-xr-edition-updates/\">Google plans to sell glasses</a> that work much like Meta&#39;s this year, though I assume they will be cheaper, since they don&#39;t use the &#34;<a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ray-ban-display-glasses-lens-screen-photos-cost-review-2025-9\">neural wristband</a>&#34; Meta includes with its glasses.

In a typical year, only a handful of colonels across the force are relieved, making the concentration among recruiters highly unusual.</p><p>The documents and interviews reveal pockets of a system that were pushed to the edge during the pandemic, when already steep recruiting goals collided with school closures, new medical-screening hurdles, and <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fewer-people-having-kids-birth-rates-pew-research-survey-2025-10\">shrinking pools of young Americans</a> eligible for service.

This move follows a blockbuster year for its <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-microsoft-ai-gpu-blackwell-cooling-wasteful-2025-12\">Blackwell chip</a>, as demand for AI infrastructure continued to surge.</p><p>In a press briefing ahead of Huang&#39;s keynote, Dion Harris, Nvidia&#39;s senior director of HPC and AI infrastructure solutions, described Vera Rubin as &#34;six chips that make one AI supercomputer.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Vera Rubin is designed to address this fundamental challenge that we have: The amount of computation necessary for AI is skyrocketing,&#34; Huang told the audience during a presentation at the CES.</p><p>Huang added that compared to the Blackwell model, Rubin marks a leap in performance, with more than triple the speed, could run inference five times faster, and can deliver significantly more inference compute per watt of energy.</p><p>Rubin was first announced in 2024 and has been slated to replace Blackwell ever since. The early debut comes months ahead of the late-2026 timeline Nvidia had previously projected.</p><p>Named after astronomer <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nvidia-chips-gpu-names\">Vera Rubin</a>, who discovered the existence of dark matter, Nvidia said in a press release that the architecture is designed to support more complex, agent-style AI workloads, as well as more networking and data movement.</p><p>The Rubin systems are already lined up for deployment across much of the cloud industry. Nvidia said partners, including <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-ai-startups-delaying-aws-spending-2025-10\">Amazon Web Services</a>, OpenAI, Anthropic, alongside the upcoming Doudna system at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, all plan to use the new platform.</p><p>The accelerated launch comes shortly after Nvidia reported record data center revenue, up 66% from a year earlier, driven largely by demand for Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra GPUs. Those chips have become a benchmark for the current AI boom are widely seen as a test of whether spending on AI infrastructure is sustainable.</p><p>Huang has previously estimated that between $3 trillion and $4 trillion could be spent globally on AI infrastructure over the next five years. Nvidia said products and services built on the Rubin platform will begin rolling out from partners in the second half of 2026.</p></div></div><div class=\"slide\"><div class=\"slide-title\">Nvidia&#39;s push into autonomous driving</div><div class=\"slide-image\"><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695c7439832e0ef1ead7360f?format=jpeg\" height=\"3462\" width=\"5199\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Self-driving car test vehicle with sticker identifying it as part of a collaboration between NVIDIA and Mercedes Benz, San Francisco, California, October 7, 2025.

Due to demand far outpacing available inventory, prices on these platforms vary significantly based on city, date, and seat location.</p><p>On StubHub, resale tickets typically start around $455 for entry‑level seats, but prices can climb as high as $1,200 or more for premium locations at popular shows. Meanwhile, Vivid Seats currently lists some of the lowest available resale options, with prices starting around $284 for select dates. However, top-tier seats in high-demand markets like Los Angeles or New York City can exceed $2,400. These ranges put the cost of seeing Grande live well above face value, but they also reflect the strong market interest in one of the year’s most anticipated pop tours.</p><hr/><p>See also: <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/stubhub-review-fees\">Is StubHub legit?</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-katseye-tickets-concert-tour\">Katseye tickets</a> | <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-pinkpantheress-tickets-concert-tour\">PinkPantheress tickets</a> |  <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-cardi-b-concert-tickets-tour\">Cardi B tickets</a> | <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-buy-blackpink-tickets-concert-tour\">Blackpink tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-buy-twice-tickets-concert-tour\">Twice tickets</a> | <a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-bad-bunny-tickets-concert-tour\">Bad Bunny tickets</a> | <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-lily-allen-tickets-concert-tour\">Lily Allen tickets</a> | <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-florence-and-the-machine-tickets-concert-tour\">Florence and the Machine tickets</a></p><p><em>Follow our </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\" nofollow\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.whatsapp.com/channel/0029Vb2J5x9J3juulcffA60F\"><em>WhatsApp channel</em></a><em> and </em><a target=\"_blank\" rel=\" nofollow\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/insiderreviews/\"><em>Instagram</em></a><em> for more deals and buying guides.</em></p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/where-to-buy-ariana-grande-tickets-concert-tour\">Business Insider</a></div>",

That is, of course, offensive to all people.&#34;</p><p>In an email on Tuesday, Nathanielsen told Business Insider that she stands by what she said in June.</p><p>&#34;The people of Greenland find the current situation unsettling, and it causes a great deal of anxiety,&#34; she wrote. &#34;We will continuously promote the idea of alliances and partnerships over colonialism.

I discovered her nearly twenty years ago, when I felt her popularity wasn’t yet abundant in the States. Songs like “Alfie”, “Knock ‘Em Out”, and “Fuck You” had poppy and upbeat tempos that got you in youthful, bold, and punchy ways. Her way of bringing colorful punch to her music has gotten me through a lot of transitional times.</p><p>However, like me, Allen has had her own bouts of heartache and painful transitional personal waves throughout the years. Her newest album is one of those that once again wears its heart on its sleeve. &#34;West End Girl&#34; has been smashing through the charts, bringing light and brashness to tales of a fearless woman tired of the toxicity of a bad marriage (hers to an actor named David Harbour) and fighting back, lyrically.</p><p>If you’re like me, you’re probably enjoying the rawness of the new album. Do you want to see the woman behind it live?

on reseller sites. Some of these are not available on US reseller sites.</p><p>For those located in the United States, know that you’ll sometimes have to look on StubHub’s UK-based site to get tickets, and, well, it’s not always the easiest to navigate. Clicking on dates for the US site will attempt to direct you to getting tickets via their overseas alternative, but the transition is sometimes finicky at best.</p><p>Folks are rushing to grab tickets on the hype of the wave of Allen’s latest album. With only a few select shows happening, the competition will be fierce. That’s not including folks outside the UK who have become fans over the years as well.</p><h2 id=\"7417ef3f-f659-4c0b-81a8-f3912c1b4318\" data-toc-id=\"7417ef3f-f659-4c0b-81a8-f3912c1b4318\"><strong>How much are tickets?</strong></h2><p>Allen’s Manchester and Glasgow shows are Allen&#39;s most expensive. Tickets for these shows are priced at over £1,000 and are extremely limited in availability.</p><p>Tickets for higher-level tier seats are also expensive, and if you can find them at all.</p><p>There is one opportunity for folks to see Allen play at a festival. Fans can purchase a ticket for the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-15116895939vu-20&amp;h=0bbbf317c5d9291e5f3cc6de044d9e60b81580f6ffff7e5da3eb2dc059ad92c8&amp;postID=695c4ba1946a298b9f8be3b8&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftickets%2Fhow-to-get-lily-allen-tickets-concert-tour&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.stubhub.com%2Fthe-mighty-hoopla-london-tickets-5-30-2026%2Fevent%2F158454556%2F%3FbackUrl%3D%252Flily-allen-tickets%252Fperformer%252F129224\" data-autoaffiliated=\"true\">Hoopla Festival</a> in Allen’s hometown of London in either single or two-day passes.</p><h2 id=\"b3d41687-38e0-46a1-af61-69d5a268b60b\" data-toc-id=\"b3d41687-38e0-46a1-af61-69d5a268b60b\"><strong>Who is opening for ’s tour?</strong></h2><p>Allen is going to be doing her own shows, primarily, except for the festivals she’s playing at, such as the Hoopla Festival. Tickets for that show sold out quickly. Allen is headlining that festival with Scissor Sisters. Other performers at the Hoopla Festival include Estelle, The Wanted 2.0, Liberty X, Cascada, Louise, Alexandra Burke, Jessie J, Perrie, Todrick Hall, Tulisa, Agnes, Heather Small, and JLS, among others.</p><h2 id=\"e603093f-55d2-4790-8ec3-e22a36cdff69\" data-toc-id=\"e603093f-55d2-4790-8ec3-e22a36cdff69\"><strong>Will there be international tour dates?</strong></h2><p>There aren’t any international tour dates announced beyond the United Kingdom. Allen’s current lineup is only a tour through the United Kingdom.</p><h2 id=\"9ae1c8f7-74d4-41a1-b03b-0b1a6f75d7b0\" data-toc-id=\"9ae1c8f7-74d4-41a1-b03b-0b1a6f75d7b0\"><strong>Who is Lily Allen’s partner?</strong></h2><p>Lily Allen’s former partner is Stranger Things actor David Harbour. The pair separated earlier this year, having been married for four years. They met on the exclusive dating app Raya in what initially seemed like a favorable meet-cute. However, as the lyrics on Allen’s album reveal, the relationship with Harbour was quite a different story. </p><p>Allen’s latest album, West End, poked back about the issues of their relationship &mdash; from feelings of insecurity to infidelity. Harbour may have the new Stranger Things season bringing him attention, but Allen’s album is also getting quite a lot of folks talking, too. Allen is reportedly openly dating on dating apps despite all of this. Perhaps a new person will appear and maybe be the source of a different form of inspiration, rather than the heartbreak and trauma that seem to have been her plight. Fans will have to wait and see.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-lily-allen-tickets-concert-tour\">Business Insider</a></div>",

That&#39;ll enable people to share reaction clips to their heart&#39;s content without fear of repercussions on platforms like Google&#39;s YouTube and Amazon&#39;s Twitch. The show kicks off on Wednesday.</p><p>It&#39;s only for one episode, but it gives MrBeast a way to have his TV cake and eat it, too &mdash; and for Amazon to juice exposure for the show.</p><p>The Amazon deal exposed MrBeast to a new audience and enabled him to create a big-budget spectacle that would have been difficult to make economically viable if it ran on YouTube. However, a potential risk was that MrBeast&#39;s fans might not follow him to Prime Video, which is behind a paywall requiring a Prime membership.</p><p>Last year, MrBeast uploaded part of the first season to YouTube to ensure his fans on that platform were aware of it. MrBeast is YouTube&#39;s top creator, with over 450 million subscribers, and regularly receives more than 100 million views and numerous comments on his YouTube videos.</p><p>Traditional media companies, such as Netflix and Fox, have been trying to stay relevant with younger viewers by striking deals with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/creators-reshaping-hollywood-youtube-netflix-2025-8\">YouTube creators</a>. The loss of fan interaction and decreased reach are concerns for some creators, though. In negotiating deals with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/netflix-video-podcast-push-shows-to-challenge-youtube-2025-11\">podcasters, Netflix</a> has told talent agents that it&#39;s exploring how to replicate community features for podcast hosts that it brings onto its platform.</p><p>Season 2 of &#34;Beast Games,&#34; which features 100 &#34;strong&#34; and 100 &#34;smart&#34; contestants competing for more than $10 million in prizes, blends elements of TV and digital platforms in other ways.</p><p>It&#39;ll include a crossover episode with &#34;Survivor,&#34; the famous reality TV show that &#34;Beast Games&#34; took inspiration from.

Due to the &#34;unprecedented&#34; demand for the specs, Meta said it would be pausing its planned expansion to the UK, France, Italy, and Canada, which was originally scheduled for early 2026.</p><p>&#34;The demand has been much higher than we anticipated,&#34; Meta&#39;s chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, said Monday during an ask-me-anything session on Instagram. He was responding to a question about when more units would be shipped to Best Buy.</p><p>&#34;As soon as we produce things, we&#39;re bringing them to stores, and they&#39;re selling out, and we&#39;re continuing to do that,&#34; he said.</p><p>He added: &#34;It&#39;s a new product, a new category, you kind of don&#39;t really know, and you want to make sure you produce to match your expected demand, and you hope to not be off by as much as we&#39;ve been off here.&#34;</p><p>The <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/meta-ray-ban-apple-imessage-integration-api-cto-andrew-bosworth-2025-9\">$799 Display glasses</a> feature a built-in screen that can display text messages, maps, and captions over the real world. It&#39;s a leap forward from the first-generation AI glasses, which functioned more like regular glasses with the addition of cameras and voice controls.</p><p>Buying the Display glasses isn&#39;t as simple as clicking &#34;add to cart.&#34; Meta requires shoppers to schedule a demo appointment at a retailer, according to its website. That&#39;s assuming there are any retailers in their area, as the glasses have rolled out to a select number of Ray-Ban, Sunglass Hut, LensCrafters, and Best Buy locations in the US.</p><p>&#34;We&#39;ll continue to focus on fulfilling orders in the US while we re-evaluate our approach to international availability,&#34; Meta wrote in its blog post.</p><p>Meta<strong> </strong>built a lot of buzz<strong> </strong>with the first iterations of the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tech/ray-ban-meta-smart-glasses-review\">AI-powered glasses</a>, which were released in October 2023. Since then, eyewear has been a key topic at Meta&#39;s splashy demo events, such as its annual developers conference, Meta Connect.</p><p>The European market has been a sticking point for tech companies, including Meta, on the regulatory front. The EU has been strict with holding global tech giants to its Digital Markets Act, a set of rules governing&nbsp;large digital platforms that provide core services, such as online search engines, app stores, and messenger services.</p><p>In April 2025, the European Commission imposed a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/apple-meta-big-tech-eu-fine-donald-trump-tariffs-negotiation-2025-4\">€200 million fine on Meta</a>, alleging that the company didn&#39;t offer a version of its services &mdash; namely its apps, Facebook and Instagram<strong> </strong>&mdash; that uses less personal data from consumers.<strong> </strong></p><p>The Display delay wouldn&#39;t mark the first time European customers have had to wait for a Meta product.

The purchase was originally valued at around $9 billion when it was announced in July, but fell to almost half of that when shares of CoreWeave dipped in the ensuing months. Shareholders in the firm rejected the deal in a vote on October 30 that reflected the concerns over the deal&#39;s weakened economics.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695d55b464858d02d217d779?format=jpeg\" height=\"320\" width=\"427\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Trip Miller\"/><figcaption>Gullane Capital Partners founder Trip Miller.<p class=\"copyright\">Gullane Capital Partners</p></figcaption></figure><p>Miller said that his expectation for the roughly 100 megawatts of near-term commitments was based on conversations he has had with knowledgeable parties outside of the company&#39;s management.

Cipher&#39;s stock, which had been trading in August for around $5 a share, jumped as high as roughly $25 in November after the announcement.</p><p>Iren, another mining firm, announced a recent $9.7 billion AI cloud computing deal with Microsoft. Last month, Hut 8, said it had signed a deal to lease a 245-megawatt data center it is developing in Louisiana to Fluidstack.</p><p>&#34;Our view is that crypto miners, by and large, are likely to pivot for the most part to delivering high-performance compute infrastructure solutions and services,&#34; Paul Golding, an analyst at Macquarie who covers the crypto mining industry, said.</p><p>In July 2025, CoreWeave said it had reached an agreement to acquire Core Scientific in a stock conversion. But in the months after the announcement, CoreWeave&#39;s shares declined and Core Scientific&#39;s rose, effectively reducing the value of CoreWeave&#39;s offer.</p><p>Since the deal&#39;s collapse, shares of Core Scientific have traded as low as below $14 a share &mdash; less than the $17 per share price that the CoreWeave deal would have amounted to.</p><p>Golding covers Core Scientific and has set a $34 target for the company&#39;s stock in October, more than double its current market price &mdash; upside that he sees stemming from its ability to tap power in a constrained utility market. That estimate is &#34;based on a sum of the parts that evaluated potential value for the uncontracted megawatts in the portfolio, the megawatt pipeline in load study phase, and the existing co-location deal with CoreWeave,&#34; Golding said.</p><p>CoreWeave is Core Scientific&#39;s only data center customer, outside of legacy crypto mining facilities it operates. Core Scientific leases 590 megawatts to CoreWeave, worth roughly $10 billion in revenue over the next 12 years, according to a spokeswoman for the company. It plans to repurpose 400 megawatts of its crypto mining operations over to high-performance computing in the next three years, the spokeswoman said.</p><p>Miller said that the upcoming leases he expects Core Scientific to announce will be with new customers.</p><p>&#34;I expect them to announce deals for AI with third parties other than CoreWeave,&#34; Miller said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/core-scientific-corz-investor-trip-miller-expects-new-ai-deals-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

It took its final bow as a franchise too big to commit to delivering real consequences to its characters.</p><p><a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stranger-things-cast-characters-then-and-now-2025-11\">Over five seasons and nine years, &#34;Stranger Things&#34;</a> has evolved from an &#39;80s-set story about a small Indiana town reeling from the sudden disappearance of a local boy into Netflix&#39;s big-budget flagship show. The fifth and final season, which premiered on Nov. 26 and concluded on New Year&#39;s Eve, <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://deadline.com/2025/12/stranger-things-5-premiere-nielsen-streaming-record-viewers-1236655429/\">broke streaming records</a> and led the platform to its <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/stranger-things-5-volume-2-ratings-netflix-views-1236620503/\">biggest Christmas Day viewership</a> of all time. It&#39;s the most-watched show in Netflix history, with over 1 billion all-time views.</p><p>Thus, the long-anticipated series finale was saddled with sky-high expectations. It&#39;s impossible to please everybody with a piece of art &mdash; especially an expectant audience of many millions, all with their own theories and favorite characters to root for &mdash; but creators and showrunners Matt and Ross Duffer were determined to try, ultimately to the show&#39;s detriment.</p><p>The series&#39; two-hour finale episode, titled &#34;The Rightside Up,&#34; has a climax and conclusion that are weakened by conspicuous fan service, cheap thrills, and <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/who-dies-stranger-things-season-5-2025-11\">shoehorned happy endings</a> for essentially all of its leads. It&#39;s the kind of CGI-fueled, character-stuffed spectacle one might expect from an &#34;Avengers&#34; film.</p><p>Gone are the shadowy threats and chill-inducing enigmas from <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stranger-things-2-review-2017-10\">seasons one and two</a>. Instead, we get a dramatic chase sequence in a space desert and a fleshy super-monster that somehow takes mere minutes to subdue. In one scene, beloved babysitter Steve (Joe Keery) falls off a collapsing radio tower and momentarily seems to plummet to his death when the screen cuts to black. But when Steve reappears, he&#39;s been miraculously rescued by his frenemy, Jonathan (Charlie Heaton), in a scene <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://x.com/Stranger_Things/status/2006863006605459713?s=20\">obviously designed for theater applause</a> (let&#39;s not forget the finale also premiered in select movie theaters across the country). Sitting at home witnessing the Marvel-ification of TV in real time, I could only laugh.</p><div id=\"1767643216656\" data-styles=\"default-width\" data-embed-type=\"custom\" data-script=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" class=\"insider-raw-embed\" data-type=\"embed\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">THE GASP HEARD IN EVERY DIMENSION <a href=\"https://t.co/y3MJdxxWUm\">pic.twitter.com/y3MJdxxWUm</a></p>&mdash; stranger things (@Stranger_Things) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Stranger_Things/status/2006863006605459713?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 1, 2026</a></blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p>Like most fans of the show, I adore Steve, and I would have been gutted if he&#39;d died. But I&#39;d much rather be gutted than utterly unmoved, and nothing about that scene made me feel like Steve was actually in danger. He&#39;s had a near-death experience in every season, just so fans will cheer when he survives.</p><h2 id=\"49ccf73d-6cd0-49ed-b000-a952fcab5b30\" data-toc-id=\"49ccf73d-6cd0-49ed-b000-a952fcab5b30\">&#39;Stranger Things&#39; used to be much more brutal</h2><p id=\"8cd51447-655f-4884-bdb0-b26b68eb7495\">I have to keep reminding myself that &#34;Stranger Things&#34; used to be a show with consequences, so I don&#39;t feel dumb for expecting to have felt <em>something</em> during the series&#39; supersized conclusion.</p><p>In the series premiere, Will (Noah Schnapp) was kidnapped before the opening credits rolled. Later in the episode, Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown) &mdash; a traumatized child who escaped from a government lab &mdash; watched the man who tried to help her get shot point-blank in the forehead. Two episodes later, another main character&#39;s best friend, <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stranger-things-season-2-justice-for-barb-2016-10\">Barb (Shannon Purser)</a>, was attacked and murdered by a faceless creature that walks on two legs.</p><p>By season five, the show&#39;s sharp, high-stakes storytelling has been deprioritized in favor of pageantry and plot armor. Apparently terrified of angering any contingent of the show&#39;s now-massive and vocal fan base, the Duffers couldn&#39;t commit to harming any core characters, despite hyping the show&#39;s main villain as an extra-dimensional embodiment of evil.</p><p>Vecna (Jamie Campbell Bower) was intent on destroying the world, and he displayed a particular sadistic fixation on Eleven, her friends, and her family. He had magical psychic powers and could exploit private fears and weaknesses. And yet, in the end, <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stranger-things-deaths-ranked-2022-7\">Vecna&#39;s head was chopped off</a> by Joyce (Winona Ryder), a normal middle-aged woman. His plan was thwarted by a group of literal children wielding guns and slingshots, all of whom made it back to our realm with hardly a scratch. Not even Max (Sadie Sink), who had her limbs snapped and her eyes gouged in season four, suffers lasting damage from her injuries.</p><h2 id=\"d6610432-3ba1-4dca-807e-6e38ca465672\" data-toc-id=\"d6610432-3ba1-4dca-807e-6e38ca465672\">The finale was too focused on pleasing everyone</h2><p id=\"c5b6ed72-840a-4626-879a-b0b31b0f4723\">Since its inception, &#34;Stranger Things&#34; has boasted an array of lovable personalities, from Steve, Jonathan, Will, and Joyce to <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stranger-things-finale-ending-gaten-matarazzo-dustin-interview-2026-1\">Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo)</a>, Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin), Mike (Finn Wolfhard), and Nancy (Natalia Dyer). Any one of their deaths would have been emotional and poignant, while reminding us of the true dangers of the world of the show &mdash; but it also would have sparked controversy and discourse online. Allowing all the show&#39;s good guys to cross the finish line was the easiest way for the Duffers to pacify as many viewers as possible. It also stripped the finale of any sense of stakes or urgency.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695c1a89832e0ef1ead72e56?format=jpeg\" height=\"1920\" width=\"3840\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in the &#34;Stranger Things&#34; epilogue.\"/><figcaption>Millie Bobby Brown as Eleven in the &#34;Stranger Things&#34; epilogue.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of Netflix</p></figcaption></figure><p>The only controversy-courting decision the Duffers made &mdash; to allow Eleven to sacrifice herself to the Upside Down for the greater good &mdash; was undermined by intentional ambiguity. Eleven was the heart of &#34;Stranger Things&#34; and, as a character, she deserved to outlive Vecna. Still, her sacrifice made narrative sense: She had long been portrayed with an abnormal capacity for altruism, and she was determined to end the cycle of violence that her magic would always invite.</p><p>However, much like Steve&#39;s, her &#34;death&#34; scene failed to induce panic. Even watching Eleven disappear as her friends cried and screamed her name &mdash; heart-wrenching performances all &mdash; I kept thinking to myself, &#34;This isn&#39;t real.&#34; The ground rule of &#34;Stranger Things&#34; is that if you don&#39;t see a dead body, that character isn&#39;t dead.</p><p>Naturally, that&#39;s exactly the effect the Duffers intended. In the show&#39;s final moments, Mike posits a theory that Eleven staged an illusion and secretly escaped. The show cuts to clips of Eleven alive and well in Iceland, finally free from the threat of capture.</p><p>The audience is left to choose whether to believe Mike&#39;s story or not, though the show makes it clear which version the writers prefer. &#34;I believe,&#34; Mike, Will, Dustin, Lucas, and Max dutifully recite.</p><p>By reframing Eleven&#39;s fate as an open-ended source of hope, the show cedes power to the viewers &mdash; exactly where it needs to be to keep the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stranger-things-play-cast-release-date-plot-spinoff-list\">still-expanding &#34;Stranger Things&#34; universe</a> humming and profitable. If Eleven reappears in a reboot in 20 years, don&#39;t say I didn&#39;t warn you.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/stranger-things-series-finale-review-character-deaths-fan-service-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

That includes researching new opportunities, <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/executive-ghostwriter-shares-ways-to-brag-on-linkedin-2025-12\">updating your LinkedIn</a>, and <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/recruiter-who-has-written-over-700-resumes-best-advice-2025-7\">refining your résumé</a>.</p><p id=\"878fc462-92fa-465b-84b3-894c97eefdc5\">It&#39;s also worth reaching out to your network.

Amy Epstein Gluck, a founding partner and chair of employment, labor, and benefits at Pierson Ferdinand LLP, said HR may be asked to confirm an employee&#39;s dates and position, and in some cases, whether they would rehire the employee.</p><p>She said many companies stick strictly to providing dates and titles, since sharing negative information can expose the company to defamation claims.</p><p id=\"7f0b5352-3ab1-4bfe-9c20-18500dfdc5e6\">&#34;You never know what a disgruntled former employee will do,&#34; Epstein Gluck said, adding that she advises her clients not to answer those kinds of questions.</p><p id=\"7f0b5352-3ab1-4bfe-9c20-18500dfdc5e6\">Even if it&#39;s unlikely that your employer would reveal whether they would rehire you, you should still have a plan for how you&#39;ll talk about your last job in interviews. It&#39;s not a good idea to lie, but you also don&#39;t need to provide a lengthy explanation on why you were fired.</p><p id=\"7f0b5352-3ab1-4bfe-9c20-18500dfdc5e6\">Morgan, at LHH, said that candidates should look forward when it comes to speaking about why they left their last job.</p><p id=\"7f0b5352-3ab1-4bfe-9c20-18500dfdc5e6\">&#34;It&#39;s generally a great idea to say, &#39;well, I was just looking for something different. I was looking for something that was more aligned to my aspirations,&#39;&#34; Morgan said.</p><p id=\"7f0b5352-3ab1-4bfe-9c20-18500dfdc5e6\">Perkins added that job seekers should refrain from speaking badly about their previous employer and avoid getting into too much detail about the reasons for leaving their previous role.</p><p id=\"7f0b5352-3ab1-4bfe-9c20-18500dfdc5e6\">&#34;The more detail you give, the more it sounds like you&#39;re trying to cover something up,&#34; Perkins said.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-to-do-if-you-get-fired-from-job-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Before World War II, it was almost unheard of for older adults to live independently or receive care outside of their families, while younger people often wouldn&#39;t move out until they got married.</p><p>But that changed for millions of American families as they lived farther apart, independent living services for seniors became more accessible, and more women joined the workforce. And a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/an-explosion-of-solo-agers-are-struggling-with-rising-costs-2025-12\">growing number</a> of older people don&#39;t have family to rely on.</p><p>&#34;We have more and more solo-agers who didn&#39;t have children or didn&#39;t get married or basically no longer have a relationship with their children,&#34; said Bob Kramer, founder of the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing and Care.</p><p>For older people in particular, living with family or in other intergenerational arrangements can be life-saving, in part because it prevents them from growing isolated.</p><p>&#34;The bottom line for solo-agers is that they need community,&#34; said Sara Zeff Geber, a solo-aging consultant. &#34;However creatively or traditionally they can work that out, that&#39;s what they&#39;re going to need if they&#39;re not going to be lonely and isolated and uncared for in their homes.&#34;</p><p>Intergenerational living &mdash;&nbsp;or sharing a home or community with unrelated people of varying ages &mdash;&nbsp;is one of those creative solutions.</p><p>On one end of the intergenerational living spectrum, an older homeowner could have a younger housemate in a cohousing arrangement. On the other end, purpose-built intergenerational communities or housing complexes are intentionally designed for both older and younger residents, often with communal spaces and programming.</p><p>A major 2024 <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.gu.org/app/uploads/2024/11/24-HousingBlueprintReport-FINAL-WEB-v2-compressed.pdf\">report on intergenerational living</a> highlighted examples of intentional communities, such as One Flushing in Queens, New York. The mixed-income complex has 231 apartments, 66 of which are reserved for older people, and a community center that brings local high schoolers in to help older adults with computer skills.</p><p>The researchers also pointed to nonprofit intergenerational housing communities in Oregon, Massachusetts, and Illinois that bring together older adults and foster families.</p><p>Still, costs remain a concern, particularly for middle-income people, who earn too much to qualify for needs-based government benefits but also struggle to afford market-rate options.</p><p>&#34;The thing that&#39;s concerning to a lot of us is that we really don&#39;t have a lot of options for modest-income folks,&#34; said Robyn Stone, a senior vice president at LeadingAge, a nonprofit that represents thousands of aging services providers, who contributed to the report.</p><p>Multigenerational or intergenerational living won&#39;t appeal to everyone. There&#39;s no one-size-fits-all housing solution for boomers, Gen Zers, or anyone in between, experts caution. People have vastly different needs, budgets, and preferences.</p><p>&#34;I don&#39;t think I would want to open my house to anybody if I were living alone,&#34; Stone said. &#34;But I think that I would want to have more of an intentional intergenerational community as I get older.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/millennials-gen-zers-boomers-multigenerational-housing-save-rent-costs-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

Young adults, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/cure-for-doomscrolling-shaming-your-friends-screentime-app-2024-10\">addicted to their phones</a> and exhausted with <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/dating-apps-bet-ai-will-increase-users-2025-12\">dating apps</a>, are resolving to seek meaning and connection IRL in ways that don&#39;t include a hangover. And there are dozens of startups capitalizing on their quests for a deeper purpose. Welcome to the year of soft partying.</p><p>Last year, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/phones-loneliness-friendship-apps-dating-fatigue-meetups-algorithms-2025-1\">friendship apps</a> and meetup groups were on the rise. People were vibing at afternoon clubbing events in cafes, coffee-and-cold-plunge sessions, group dance classes, run clubs, and Zillennial-branded churches. Some embraced the idea that being <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/going-offline-became-new-luxury-dating-phones-apps-2025-11\">offline is the new luxury</a>. &#34;The hunger and the need for a deeper meaning and deeper connections is there,&#34; says Andrew Roth, founder of Offline, a platform that helps people find in-person communities and connect with brands to co-host or be part of in-person events.</p><p>Those who want to get out and meet new people are seeking new ways to do so beyond late nights at bars. Mike Vosters, founder of Matinee Social Club, which hosts early start and end dance parties for people 30 and older at iconic New York clubs like Joyface and Mr. Purple, says one of the problems with traditional clubbing is that &#34;nightlife in general is marketed in a very shallow way.&#34; Long lines, late nights, bottle service, and the need to have the right look create an air of exclusivity, but also intimidate people. For the over 30 crowd, knowing that they can buy a ticket and dance among their peers and be home early is a shift that makes it more inclusive, and Matinee now hosts about three events each weekend in the city. &#34;Nightlife&#39;s not dead at all,&#34; Vosters says. &#34;I just think that nightlife needs to change.&#34;</p><p>Laura Baginski runs a similar venture, Earlybirds Club, a dance party that runs from 6 to 10 p.m. and generally attracts women, queer, trans, and non-binary people between the ages of 35 and 55. Most events across the country throughout January have already sold out. The early start and stop not only means less drinking and a full eight hours of sleep, it&#39;s also designed to be a safe space to meet new people, Baginski tells me. &#34;Going alone doesn&#39;t feel strange, everyone is very open,&#34; Baginski says. &#34;There&#39;s something different about dancing that really releases some tension and stress and allows you to connect with people in a different way than just sitting at a table and talking.&#34;</p><es-blockquote data-quote=\"We have to all start retraining ourselves to be social people again.\" data-styles=\"pullquote-breakout\" data-source=\"Brigette Polster, 31\"><blockquote class=\"pullquote-wrapper pullquote-breakout\"><q class=\"pullquote-quotation\">We have to all start retraining ourselves to be social people again.</q><cite class=\"pullquote-source\">Brigette Polster, 31</cite></blockquote></es-blockquote><p>Sweatpals, an app that lets people find workouts and connect with their fellow gym buffs, is also capitalizing on the rising drives for both fitness and friendship. The app has raised $16 million, and connects people to events in more than a dozen cities. &#34;They&#39;re looking at it as a way to date, as a way to meet &mdash; not just to work out,&#34; Salar Shahini, Sweatpals founder, tells me. &#34;Before COVID, I think it was moving towards people just doing YouTube workouts. Now it&#39;s becoming the opposite. It&#39;s very community-based, social, and people are less interested in drinking.&#34;</p><p>In 2025, 22% of American adults said they planned to participate in Dry January according to a Morning Consult poll, a new high. Gen Z already drinks less than older generations year-round. One in five adults under the age of 35 were interested in alcohol free events, according to a 2025 report from Eventbrite. Companies like Sweatpals or Coffee and Chill (a cold plunge social club) are showcasing a new way of socializing that aligns with Gen Z&#39;s sober-curious values. It&#39;s a stark contrast to what some older pundits think will fix loneliness. Scott Galloway, author of the recent book &#34;Notes on Being a Man,&#34; believes that &#34;the worst thing that&#39;s happened to young people is the anti-alcohol movement,&#34; as he recently told Bill Maher. &#34;The risks to your 25-year-old liver are dwarfed by the risk of social isolation. … Get out, drink more, and make a series of bad decisions that might pay off.&#34; That advice fails to capture the interest of many Gen Zers. &#34;Social fitness is a new social currency,&#34; says Brian Cho, cofounder at Patron, a venture capital firm that invested in Sweatpals.</p><p>People expect more from their outings. There&#39;s Lectures on Tap, which brings college professors and experts to lecture at bars. Book clubs have moved from living rooms to bars and parties. A <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/philosophy-club-is-hot-just-ask-these-gen-z-new-yorkers\">philosophy club</a> is stirring up debates on objective truth and animal hierarchy in New York City bars. Andrew Yeung, founder of Fibe, a think tank and tech networking community, says he believes people in their mid- to late twenties are hungry for part of the college experience they lost during the pandemic. &#34;What they want to go to is this whole new category of leisure events around pursuing your intellectual curiosity and learning new things,&#34; Yeung says.</p><p>Luke Evans, a 33-year-old who runs a toy and game business, found he was hit with a new sense of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-loneliness-does-to-the-body-and-brain-2023-12\">loneliness</a> upon relocating from outside of London to the city in 2025. He took an improv class to meet people, and has set a new goal of trying something new each month in 2026. He&#39;s eyeing a book club, a hiking club, and archery. The stigma around confessing that one feels lonely has subsided &mdash; perhaps thanks to all the attention on loneliness. When Evans put himself out there at improv, he found that &#34;everyone&#39;s in the same boat. Everyone feels a bit relieved that, oh, I&#39;m not the only one who was feeling this way,&#34; he tells me. &#34;People are almost desperate to talk about it.&#34;</p><p>Brigette Polster, 31, made a commitment for 2026: no more dating apps. She&#39;s prioritizing going to bars and restaurants alone, and trying to meet people via her hobbies, which include horseback riding, flyfishing, and working out. She also wants single friends, so she started a Single Girls Night Out meetup. In just a month, Polster gained 1,500 followers on the club&#39;s Instagram account, and hosted meetups in New Jersey and Florida. &#34;We have to all start retraining ourselves to be social people again,&#34; Polster says.</p><hr/><p><a target=\"_self\" rel=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/author/amanda-hoover\"><em><u>Amanda Hoover</u></em></a><em> is a senior correspondent at Business Insider covering the tech industry.

during his visit. You can purchase those tickets directly from Live Nation or through resellers. Whether you can get a deal via a reseller is subjective: some dates and locations will be a lot more expensive on reseller sites. Others may be comparable. Thankfully, we’ve done some of the legwork here, so you can determine which is best for you cost-wise.</p><h2 id=\"f2455017-63eb-467f-b5ad-0dfd65b9288a\" data-toc-id=\"f2455017-63eb-467f-b5ad-0dfd65b9288a\"><strong>How much are tickets?</strong></h2><p>Despite being a legendary performer, several of Rod Stewart’s shows are actually remarkably accessible in price, depending on the location. His lowest-priced shows are on August 15th in Riverside, MO, and cost only <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://affiliate.insider.com?amazonTrackingID=bi-auto-15116894549gh-20&amp;h=81c6b79bf361ac55ad2a1d416182a8f8b312201cbe16a7b0484acfc0b86240d7&amp;postID=695c393fcefbf494a47352bb&amp;postSlug=guides%2Ftickets%2Fhow-to-get-rod-stewart-tickets-concert-tour&amp;site=bi&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.vividseats.com%2Frod-stewart-tickets-riverside-morton-amphitheater-8-15-2026--concerts-adult-contemporary%2Fproduction%2F6268983%3Fquantity%3D1\" data-autoaffiliated=\"true\">$50</a> for lawn seats. However, some of his shows are really expensive, even at their lowest price offerings via resellers.</p><p>**The February 28 show, for example, is not currently showing on&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.livenation.com/artist/K8vZ917135f/rod-stewart-events\">Live Nation</a>&nbsp;or VividSeats, but has been changed to be available on December 2 or has been postponed. It is priced at over a grand for the lowest price available options. It is currently unknown when the show may be rescheduled.</p><h2 id=\"b55acc08-e689-48c4-a609-a300b53eccca\" data-toc-id=\"b55acc08-e689-48c4-a609-a300b53eccca\"><strong>Who is opening for Rod Stewart’s tour?</strong></h2><p>Earlier this month, Howard Jones and Richard Marx were announced as opening acts for Stewart’s newly announced shows in March and August. Given the current trend, further surprises and additions may be forthcoming.</p><h2 id=\"f75a62c1-2bae-493b-93ac-b382616d58a8\" data-toc-id=\"f75a62c1-2bae-493b-93ac-b382616d58a8\"><strong>Will there be international tour dates?</strong></h2><p>Rod Stewart has publicly said that it’s “the end of large-scale world tours” for him. A majority of these concert dates are performances within the United States, with three exceptions: two shows in Canada and one show in Spain.</p><h2 id=\"bbd64947-7861-4c21-81e3-b3175d3f62f1\" data-toc-id=\"bbd64947-7861-4c21-81e3-b3175d3f62f1\"><strong>How old is Rod Stewart?</strong></h2><p>Rod Stewart was born on January 20th, 1945, making him eighty years young. Although he has experienced various health issues, especially over the recent years, last year he posted on Instagram that while he “has no desire to retire”. He will probably be “Forever Young” to many.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/guides/tickets/how-to-get-rod-stewart-tickets-concert-tour\">Business Insider</a></div>",

They also accused him and his wife, Cilia Flores, of conspiring to illegally import cocaine into the United States and of gun-related charges.</p><p>On Monday afternoon, US Marshals escorted the couple into a 26th-floor courtroom in lower Manhattan, where they entered not-guilty pleas and proclaimed their innocence. <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/videos-shows-venezuelan-president-nicolas-maduro-arriving-in-new-york-2026-1\">US military forces apprehended Maduro and Flores</a> in a pre-dawn operation on Saturday in the Venezuelan capital of Caracas and brought them to the United States.</p><p>At the hearing, Pollack told US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein that he would file &#34;voluminous and complicated&#34; motions on Maduro&#39;s behalf, suggesting he would challenge the charges and the basis for his arrest.</p><p>&#34;Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,&#34; Pollack said in court. &#34;He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.&#34;</p><p>Delcy Rodriguez was sworn in as Venezuela&#39;s interim president on Monday afternoon. </p><p>Pollack, an attorney at the boutique law firm Harris St. Laurent &amp; Wechsler LLP, is best known as one of the many lawyers who represented Assange, the publisher of WikiLeaks.</p><p>Prosecutors had accused Assange of working with hackers to obtain government secrets from federal agencies and American companies, as well as conspiring with former US Army officer Chelsea Manning to leak documents about the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.</p><p>Assange pleaded guilty to espionage charges in the summer of 2024, capping a six-year legal battle that involved complex negotiations with multiple governments.</p><p>Pollack&#39;s experience with sensitive national security matters could be an asset for his representation of Maduro, which will likely involve classified information. The attorney has also represented Jeffrey Sterling, a former CIA officer who was convicted of espionage charges after leaking information to a journalist.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695c2f6f64858d02d217c62a?format=jpeg\" height=\"2000\" width=\"3000\" charset=\"\" alt=\"barry pollack nicolas maduro\"/><figcaption>Barry Pollack, on the left, represented Maduro in Manhattan federal court on Monday afternoon.<p class=\"copyright\">Jane Rosenberg/Reuters</p></figcaption></figure><p>To be paid, Pollack will likely need a waiver from the US Treasury Department, which has sanctioned Maduro and the Venezuelan government.</p><p>It&#39;s not clear when Pollack began representing Maduro. He formally entered an appearance on the court docket late Monday morning. Maduro was first indicted in 2020, and Hellerstein has overseen court proceedings against other Venezuelan nationals accused of conspiring with him. Pollack didn&#39;t respond to Business Insider&#39;s request for comment.</p><p>A court-appointed lawyer for Maduro, David Wikstrom, told Business Insider he was informed at 8:40 a.m. on Monday that he would be representing the Venezuelan president in court. Shortly before the noon court hearing,  he said he still hadn&#39;t spoken to Pollack, who ultimately represented Maduro in the proceeding.</p><p>Flores is represented by Mark Donnelly, a Texas-based attorney who served as a federal prosecutor for 12 years, and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.</p><p>Pollack, a former public defender and president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, has a long track record of successful defense outcomes in criminal trials.</p><p>He represented former Enron accountant Michael W. Krautz, who a jury acquitted of fraud charges. And he successfully overturned the conviction of Martin Tankleff, a Long Island man who spent 17 years in prison after he was falsely accused of killing his parents as a teenager.</p><p>More recently, Pollack represented the executive of a poultry company accused of conspiring to fix the price of chickens. Jurors declined to find the executive guilty in two separate trials.</p><p>In <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.lawdragon.com/lawyer-limelights/2025-04-03-defending-julian-assange-barry-pollack-on-the-historic-plea-deal-and-the-future-of-white-collar-defense\">a 2025 interview with Lawdragon</a>, Pollack decried the Justice Department&#39;s &#34;extraordinary view&#34; of its jurisdiction for criminal cases, using the Assange case as an example.</p><p>&#34;You&#39;ve got somebody who&#39;s not a United States citizen who is publishing information not in the United States, had not set foot in the United States, with respect to any of the alleged offensive conduct,&#34; Pollack said. &#34;The information was leaked to him by somebody in Iraq. Yet the United States obviously felt that it could pursue that as a criminal offense in the United States.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/barry-pollack-nicolas-maduros-lawyer-represented-julian-assange-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

The <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/nato-watching-ukraine-ways-to-kill-drones-without-expensive-missiles-2025-12\">counter-drone fight</a> will require a mix of different tools, from ways to physically shoot down drones to electronic and other non-kinetic solutions.</p><p>It also demands easier, faster processes for testing and buying systems across the services.</p><p>The task force was created last fall to expedite counter-drone technologies across the Department of Defense, replacing the Joint Counter-small Unmanned Aircraft Systems Office, which was established in 2019. Since its establishment, the task force has assessed and contributed to the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/anti-drone-kits-headed-to-us-military-bases-amid-threats-2025-9\">US military&#39;s counter-drone arsenal</a>, including forces at home and abroad.</p><p>But there&#39;s no one system they&#39;ve found that can stop small uncrewed aerial systems, or UAS, which the task force&#39;s commander, Brig. Gen. Matt Ross, called &#34;the defining threat of our time.&#34;</p><p>&#34;There&#39;s no silver bullet for counter-UAS. There&#39;s just not,&#34; Ross said last month at a media roundtable. &#34;If there was, we would already have it,&#34; he added.</p><p>Instead, the task force is focused on a suite of technologies for layered, integrated protection from drones. &#34;Our formations must be able to detect, track, identify, and defeat these systems anywhere on the planet,&#34; Ross said. &#34;This requires us to layer our defenses by integrating sensors with <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/new-marine-tech-turn-light-vehicles-into-drone-aircraft-killers-2025-12\">kinetic and non-kinetic effectors</a> and battle management systems into a responsive, interoperable network.&#34;</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/695c1c9364858d02d217c36c?format=jpeg\" height=\"5504\" width=\"8256\" charset=\"\" alt=\"A small drone hovers in the air at night.\"/><figcaption>The task force has also led exercises to train personnel on detecting, identifying, and taking out small drones.<p class=\"copyright\">US Army photo by Sgt. Wesley Domalewski</p></figcaption></figure><p>He said that many defense technologies already exist for countering medium-sized drones, which the Pentagon classifies as Group 3, but more work remains in smaller drones under Group 1 and 2, UAS such as the quadcopters that dominate in Ukraine.</p><p>And the counter-drone problem isn&#39;t<strong> </strong>just about what systems are needed to protect service members and civilians. &#34;The technology is not going to solve this problem for us. We can&#39;t field a system that will stop every drone. It will all come down to the installation commander or the person responsible for that site and how they use the tools that we provide them,&#34; Ross said.</p><p>In its first 100 days, the task force has identified a key goal: creating a shared command-and-control system that makes it easier for different teams and regions to share data. It also wants to build a marketplace where the military services, law enforcement, and other agencies can find counter-drone systems suited to their specific threats, review performance data and user feedback, and potentially buy those systems in one place.</p><p>The task force notably isn&#39;t operating in isolation. There&#39;s overlap between the task force&#39;s focus on stopping Group 3 drones,<strong> </strong>systems like <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/coast-guard-drone-hunt-drug-runners-landmark-cocaine-haul-2025-11\">Shield AI&#39;s V-BAT</a> or the Army&#39;s AAI RQ-7, and the responsibilities of the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/trump-golden-dome-space-weapons-ready-3-years-cost-2025-5\">Golden Dome missile defense project</a>, which has to include defenses for Group 3 drones.</p><p>The task force plans to share data with the Golden Dome project, and Ross said he&#39;s currently discussing what that looks like with Space Force&#39;s Gen. Michael Guetlein.</p><p>Another priority for the task force is helping protect against small drones at major events, including the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/fifa-2026-world-cup-ticket-prices-expensive-usa-canada-mexico-2025-12\">FIFA World Cup</a> this year, with matches set to be held at 11 large stadiums in cities across the US.</p><p>Ross said that based on US forces overseas, &#34;we&#39;re heavily indexed against Group 3 systems, and those are larger systems that fly a longer distance and carry heavier payloads. And I want to make sure that we have just as robust protection against Group 1 and Group 2 systems that are smaller and much more likely to be seen over a widely attended gathering, stadium, or a watch party specifically for the World Cup.&#34;</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/no-single-weapon-going-to-defeat-all-drone-threats-commander-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

However, following oral instructions can be particularly challenging for non-auditory learners.</p><p>For example, when doing <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/tried-reformer-pilates-loved-it-would-do-again-2024-1\">reformer Pilates classes</a>, the springs can be adjusted to increase or decrease resistance. Many first-timers attend Pilates classes with a gym mindset, assuming heavier loads produce the best results.</p><p>However, when taking a class, you should never ignore the instructor&#39;s directions on how much resistance to use. Following directions is essential for staying safe and seeing results.</p><h2 id=\"8116ecfd-cfa3-4169-ae70-c176468990b4\" data-toc-id=\"8116ecfd-cfa3-4169-ae70-c176468990b4\">Not breathing correctly during class</h2><p id=\"8116ecfd-cfa3-4169-ae70-c176468990b4\">Pilates uses a technique known as lateral breathing to stabilize the trunk (chest, abdomen, pelvis, and back) while you move. This helps prevent unwanted pelvis movement or an arched back.</p><p id=\"8116ecfd-cfa3-4169-ae70-c176468990b4\">Good form during exercise allows for proper muscle recruitment and helps prevent injuries, which is why I always remind my students to be mindful of their breath.</p><p id=\"8116ecfd-cfa3-4169-ae70-c176468990b4\">However, it&#39;s important to remember that engaging your core and developing breathing techniques takes time.

A <a target=\"_blank\" class=\"editor-rtfLink\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/ways-to-use-protein-powder-2018-10\">protein shake</a> or a rice cake with peanut butter are good options if you&#39;re taking an early class.</p><p>For those who prefer to exercise on their lunch break, a small salad with light protein will do the trick.

I am not guilty. I am a decent man. I am still president of my country,&#34; Maduro told the judge through an interpreter when asked for his plea on narco-terrorism and weapons charges.</p><p>He was then interrupted by the judge, who interjected, &#34;A not guilty plea will be entered on behalf of Mr. Maduro.&#34;</p><p>It was one of several dramatic moments during the roughly 30-minute hearing, which Maduro used to protest his capture by US forces.</p><p>When he entered the courtroom, flanked by US marshals, he wished everyone a &#34;Happy New Year&#34; in English and locked eyes with members of the press sitting in the back of the courtroom.</p><p>Later, as the hearing wrapped up, a person sitting in the fourth row of the courtroom gallery stood to say Maduro would pay in the name of the Venezuelan people.</p><p>&#34;I am a man of God, and I am a war prisoner,&#34; Maduro responded in Spanish as US marshals escorted him out of the courtroom.</p><p>Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, were arraigned on an indictment alleging a conspiracy to import cocaine and a related conspiracy to possess machine guns and other &#34;destructive devices&#34; in furtherance of drug trafficking. Maduro also faces a narco-terrorism conspiracy charge.</p><p>The two wore standard-issue jail garb of navy smocks over orange long-sleeve shirts with khaki pants. At their seats in the courtroom, they wore headphones to listen to their court-appointed translators.</p><p>When he stood to address the judge, Maduro held on to the arms of his chair as he rose unsteadily. Flores, her blonde hair tied back in a bun, had several small bandages on her face. She sustained injuries during her &#34;abduction&#34; in Caracas, one of her attorneys said.</p><p>During the packed noon hearing, US District Judge Alvin Hellerstein read the couple a summary of their charges and informed the Venezuelan president and first lady of their rights before the pair entered not guilty pleas. He addressed them as &#34;Mr. Maduro&#34; and &#34;Ms. Flores.&#34;</p><p>When asked to confirm his identity at the start of the hearing, Maduro began by stating in firmly spoken Spanish that he is &#34;Presidente constitutional de la Republica Venezuela.&#34;</p><p>&#34;I am here, kidnapped, since January 3, Saturday,&#34; Maduro said. I was captured in my home in Caracas, Venezuela.&#34;</p><p>&#34;There will be a time and place to go into all this,&#34; the judge interrupted.</p><p>Asked for her plea, Flores spoke in a quiet, hoarse voice.</p><p>&#34;Not guilty. Completely innocent,&#34; she said through a court interpreter.</p><p>Both Maduro and Flores are facing health issues and will need medical attention while awaiting trial, their lawyers said.</p><p>&#34;Miss Flores, during her abduction, sustained significant injuries, as you can see today here in court,&#34; defense lawyer Mark Donnelly told the judge. &#34;There&#39;s a belief that she may have a fracture or severe bruising on her ribs,&#34; the lawyer added.</p><p>The 25-page indictment filed against Maduro, his wife, son, and three others alleges that for over 25 years, Venezuelan leaders &#34;have abused their positions of public trust and corrupted once-legitimate institutions to import tons of cocaine into the United States.&#34;</p><p>Maduro was represented in court by Barry Pollack, an attorney best known for also representing WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange. Flores was represented by the Texas-based attorney Mark Donnelly and one of his law partners, Andres Sanchez.</p><p>The attorneys said they would not seek bail for Maduro or Flores on Monday, but reserved the right to seek it at a later date. Pollack told Hellerstein he anticipated &#34;voluminous and complicated legal practice.&#34;</p><p>&#34;Mr. Maduro is the head of a sovereign state,&#34; Pollack said. &#34;He is entitled to the privileges and immunities that go with that office. In addition, there are issues about the legality of this military abduction.&#34;</p><p>Hellerstein scheduled the next court hearing for March 17.</p><p><a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/what-we-know-us-assault-raid-on-venezuela-capture-maduro-2026-1\">Maduro has long been a target</a> of the US Justice Department. Manhattan federal prosecutors first indicted him in 2020, accusing him of heading the drug-trafficking network, the Cartel de los Soles.</p><p>In 2015, the nephews of Maduro&#39;s wife, Flores, were arrested in Haiti and charged with drug trafficking by the same office handling the Maduro case.</p><p>The indictment says Maduro is &#34;at the forefront of that corruption and has partnered with his co-conspirators to use his illegally obtained authority and the institutions he corroded to transport thousands of tons of cocaine to the United States.&#34;</p><p>On Saturday, President Donald Trump said the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/key-things-trump-said-about-venezuela-raid-oil-maduro-capture-2026-1\">US captured the Venezuelan president</a> following large-scale strikes on the South American nation.</p><p>Trump said the US will &#34;run&#34; Venezuela until a &#34;safe, proper, and judicious transition&#34; can be facilitated.

I didn&#39;t get coding at all.

It was the same thing every day: sitting at the same table from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., queuing for lunch at a crowded food court, and taking the train home.</p><p>The only comfort was sleeping in the office chair.

I met a lot of people who were from different walks of life, and that made me feel it&#39;s OK to go and do different things.</p><p>My first manager had been a doctor in the UK who left practice because she felt the healthcare system was broken. She joined McKinsey to do healthcare work. One of my favorite bosses had been in the US Marines and went to Iraq. He did an MBA and joined the firm after that.</p><p>I moved back to Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic, and McKinsey became less fun because everything was remote. The thing I enjoyed most &mdash; the people &mdash; began to decline.</p><p>I knew I wanted to start something, but I realized I was pushing it off because it was hard to make a move during the pandemic. At some point, it felt like I was doing my job out of inertia.</p><h2 id=\"8a7d1714-be30-4970-90bf-7709042af297\" data-toc-id=\"8a7d1714-be30-4970-90bf-7709042af297\"><strong>From McKinsey to startup life</strong></h2><p>I left McKinsey in 2021 at the age of 27 and worked at a Singapore-based AI startup for two years, leading the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/startups-founder-ai-vision-meta-tips-product-market-fit-2025-5\">go-to-market strategy</a>.</p><p>I went from being in a huge office with all kinds of perks to being in a <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/verci-coworking-social-hub-gen-z-consumer-tech-startups-2025-3\">coworking space</a> with just two other people, and we had to figure everything out from scratch.</p><p>I told my founder in the first month, &#34;Maybe I should just go back to McKinsey because this feels too scary.&#34; I don&#39;t know if the company will be around in a year. What if I need to look for a job?</p><p>A lot of it is irrational because, honestly, we raised a lot of money, and we were a good company, and I&#39;m sure I could find a job.</p><p>The startup was acquired in 2023, and I cofounded Havana, a startup specializing in AI agents for student recruitment and enrollment teams.</p><p>I was told that the most important and <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/quit-big-tech-for-startups-risk-was-worth-it-2025-11\">hardest thing in a startup</a> is managing my own psychology.</p><p>It&#39;s not learning how to build a new product or how to sell. If you are able to manage your psychology, then you will have the morale to learn all these things. As long as you work hard and you&#39;re capable, anyone can figure these things out. Most people, at some point, lose morale, or they just feel like it sucks too much.</p><p>There are a lot of things that can distract you. You can think, &#34;Oh, my other friends are doing X, Y, Z, and their life seems easier.&#34; You have to learn to shut down these distracting thoughts when you are in a career with a lot of openness and uncertainty.</p><h2 id=\"49d434d8-8590-411e-8ad9-395cb9f62b78\" data-toc-id=\"49d434d8-8590-411e-8ad9-395cb9f62b78\"><strong>Unlearning habits from consulting</strong></h2><p>The <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/bcg-consultant-burnt-out-left-founded-ai-startup-2025-8\">most important skill</a> I learned at McKinsey is how to navigate clients.</p><p>Typically, they are more senior and older than us. They have multiple departments, and you need to know how to run a meeting efficiently and understand everyone&#39;s needs. The startup that I&#39;m running now sells to universities, which are bigger than us, so that&#39;s a useful skill.</p><p>Consulting also trained me to be organized and structured. I learned to prioritize ruthlessly and do things fast because timelines are always tight.</p><p>There are also some things I had to unlearn. <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/left-bain-launch-ai-startup-consulting-lessons-bluente-2025-9\">Consultants are trained</a> to overanalyze and rely on data to figure out the most optimal solution. That&#39;s OK for big companies.</p><p>In a startup, when you&#39;re trying to make decisions, you&#39;ll never have enough data. You just have to have the guts to do one thing. If it doesn&#39;t work, go and do the second thing.</p><p>When I first left consulting, I struggled with that. I would take a bit too long to try to get data, talk to more people, and read more books before choosing the right path.</p><p>Early on, we conducted customer interviews before building the product. My cofounder and I would spend a lot of time discussing: Is this the pain point we want to solve? Does this feel big enough? What&#39;s the first version of the product we should build?</p><p>It&#39;s very ambiguous, like trying to get some kind of instinct through research. Over time, we began building the product and attracting customers, and then a bit more rhythm emerged.</p><p>Now, I don&#39;t feel like I have to have all the knowledge. I&#39;m <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/six-figure-salary-jobs-quit-risk-jpmorgan-hims-cofounder-startups-2025-10\">comfortable taking risks</a> and making decisions.</p><p>As a startup founder, I&#39;ve also gotten a lot more comfortable with speaking more. When I was at McKinsey, my managers would say I needed to speak up more in meetings and show senior leaders that I was the one who did the work.</p><p>If you run a business and are the only <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/companies-founded-by-former-consultants-warby-parker-doordash-faire-bonobos-2025-3\">non-technical founder</a>, you have to talk to customers every day.

She&#39;d lived a self-proclaimed glamorous life before meeting my dad and becoming surprisingly pregnant with me at 39.</p><p>Before that, she was a &#34;walking model&#34; at Bal Harbour Shops in the 70s, touting signage from the then-emerging designers of couture.

She refused medical advice to be added to a heart transplant list and was vehemently against keeping a low-sodium diet. For this, I was angry. I plead with her. I begged. Did she want to live? What if I were to get married one day? Wouldn&#39;t she want to meet her future grandkids? All she wanted was sodium-rich tomato soup. I was so mad, I decided to cut my trip short so I didn&#39;t have to watch her kill herself. Harsh, maybe, but that&#39;s what it felt like at the time.</p><p>&#34;Won&#39;t you stay and hold my hand?&#34; she asked before I left.</p><p>She died a few weeks later from sepsis after another heart attack.

I mean it in the most endearing way. He was a New York Jew who grew up at the tail end of the Great Depression and was generally satisfied as long as he had a Miami Hurricanes game on and a palmful of peanuts that, in his final hours, he wouldn&#39;t be able to swallow. It was then that I&#39;d watch the games with him and drop ice chips into his mouth to offer some relief.</p><p>I knew it wouldn&#39;t be long before he died, but I guess I expected to be there when it happened. Instead, I got a call very early one morning to let me know that my father had &#34;expired.&#34;<strong> </strong>Like a carton of milk.</p><h2 id=\"b0aa7285-05c7-4181-b67e-3adcd7d8149e\" data-toc-id=\"b0aa7285-05c7-4181-b67e-3adcd7d8149e\"><strong>My son&#39;s snake bite taught me something important</strong></h2><p>In the weeks leading up to Madsen&#39;s snake bite, we were preparing to move across the country to be closer to Mac&#39;s family. The decision was made at the last minute, and we had limited assistance. We were moving so fast, we forgot what mattered until Mads was admitted to the ICU.</p><p>A decade ago, I had somehow mistaken my mother&#39;s autonomy for abandonment. It was only now that I understood, far too late, that my mom needed me just as much as I needed her.</p><p>Madsen received 21 doses of anti-venom over a 72-hour period. And it worked. When I saw him, he kept saying &#34;I got you!&#34; which is what Mac had been telling him since they arrived.</p><p>&#34;I got you, too, little buddy,&#34; I said and held his hand in mine.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/toddler-rattlesnake-bite-grief-lessons-from-parental-loss-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

When he needed a bathroom break, he opted for nature pees in the backyard.</p><p>But then, as I made lunch, George scooted into the bathroom and slammed the door.</p><p>I gave him some time, then slowly, silently, peeked inside. He wasn&#39;t sitting. He wasn&#39;t standing. He was kneeling &mdash; reaching toward the back wall with a gigantic wad of toilet paper. The bowl was clogged with more paper &mdash; voluminous amounts of it.</p><p>What I wanted to say: WE TALKED ABOUT THIS! </p><p>What I actually said: Nothing.

They had <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/airbus-adding-bunk-beds-playground-slides-bar-new-jets-2018-4\">bunk beds</a>, but instead of using the top and bottom, George and Stanley chose to sleep side by side, arms around each other, in the bottom bunk.</p><p>Stanley took one look at George on his knees, flashed a big smile, and suggested I praise him for his good work.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/69304efc7ecd1d1da662d4dd?format=jpeg\" height=\"768\" width=\"1024\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Family brushing teeth together\"/><figcaption>The author learned an important lesson from her grankids.<p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of the author</p></figcaption></figure><p>Then Stanley looked right at George and told him what a good boy he was. No mention of clogging the toilet. No scolding that the mess was unnecessary. No criticism of the sticky wet floor. Not even a reminder to wash his hands. Just arms open for a hug.</p><p>I stood there speechless for a few seconds. Where I saw disaster, Stanley saw effort. While I considered a lecture, he opened his arms.</p><p>I herded both boys to the sink for hand washing before lunch. After a bite to eat, we played with Monster Trucks, and when George got cranky, I put him in bed for a nap. Then I played cards with Stanley and cleaned the bathroom with chlorine bleach.</p><p>When George woke up, my husband suggested an hour at the park.

His tiny fingers curled into my fist said he wanted us to be right again.</p><p>At bedtime, when he usually chose Grandpa, George asked me to read him a book. Five books. We didn&#39;t talk about bathrooms or disinfectants or a better aim. I just snuggled him in my lap, pulled a blanket over us, and read the words slowly, to enjoy the story a little longer. I tucked him under the covers with <em>Doggie, </em>his favorite stuffed toy. I kissed him and said I love you.</p><figure><img src=\"https://i.insider.com/69304f6e7ecd1d1da662d4ee?format=jpeg\" height=\"1085\" width=\"1446\" charset=\"\" alt=\"Grandparents with kids\"/><figcaption><p class=\"copyright\">Courtesy of the author</p></figcaption></figure><p>It was 8 p.m. when I joined Grandpa in the living room, too tired to read my own book, pick up stray Hot Wheels, or <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/parent-save-time-procrastination-best-tips-chores-2023-11\">empty the dishwasher</a>.

I once spent an entire afternoon there with a latte, a slice of cake, and a book.</p><p>I&#39;ve also found it to be an ideal venue for gathering with friends, wearing noise-canceling headphones and working, or cozying away with a notebook. Be prepared to wait for a table, though, as this café is usually crowded.</p><p>Brew Tea Bar, which has four locations, offers some of the <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/taiwan-original-boba-tea-starbucks-chun-shui-tang-competition-tptea-2024-7\">best bubble tea</a> in Las Vegas.

I&#39;ve enjoyed hiking Pine Creek Canyon for its relative ease, although more challenging trails like Ice Box Canyon and Turtlehead Peak offer scrambling, waterfall trails, and steeper inclines.</p><p>Free and open to the public, the Henderson Bird Viewing Preserve is often busy with birdwatchers early in the morning &mdash; but busy doesn&#39;t always mean loud. If you get there at 7 a.m., you&#39;ll hear more birdsong than human chatter.</p><p>Ideal for families, friend groups, and solo exploration, the 140-acre area was originally founded in 1998 when environmentalists struck a deal with the city to transform wastewater into a conservation area.</p><p>Renowned among birders, this nature spot features many migratory birds, such as yellow-headed blackbirds, common gallinules, and eared grebes &mdash; and that is reason enough to take <a target=\"\" class=\"\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/visiting-las-vegas-on-a-budget-travel-hacks-savings-tips-2025-2\">flight to Las Vegas</a>.</p><div class=\"read-original\">Read the original article on <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/calm-things-to-do-las-vegas-cozy-ideas-cafes-hiking-2026-1\">Business Insider</a></div>",

So people&#39;s brains are systematically misinterpreting the state of the world.&nbsp;</p><p>&#34;Something that really hits on that point is the beginning of the book.
