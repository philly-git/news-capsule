The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) identified the agents involved as U.S. Border Patrol employees, though Portland police chief Bob Day said it remains unclear if the shooting was an &ldquo;immigration-related event.&rdquo;</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Portland, a known liberal hub that identifies as a &ldquo;<a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/federal/sanctuary-city\"  target=\"_blank\">sanctuary city</a>,&rdquo; has been the subject of intensified immigration enforcement actions during President Donald Trump&rsquo;s second term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Day said the incident on Thursday is still in its &ldquo;early stages&rdquo; and urged the community &ldquo;to remain calm as we work to learn more,&rdquo; recognizing the &ldquo;heightened emotion and tension many are feeling in the wake of the shooting in Minneapolis.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Portland Mayor Keith Wilson has already echoed similar <a href=\"https://time.com/7344506/minneapolis-ice-shooting-mayor/\" >demands from Minneapolis officials</a> for ICE to end its operations in the city.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Portland is not a &lsquo;training ground&rsquo; for militarized agents, and the &lsquo;full force&rsquo; threatened by the Administration has deadly consequences,&rdquo; Wilson <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/mayor/keith-wilson/news/2026/1/8/portland-mayor-issues-statement-following-hazelwood-neighborhood\"  target=\"_blank\">said in a statement</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Maxine Dexter, a Democrat who represents the Oregon district where the shooting occurred, also said in a statement <a href=\"https://x.com/RepDexterOR/status/2009422415865192914\"  target=\"_blank\">posted on X</a> that ICE has &ldquo;done nothing but inject terror, chaos, and cruelty into our communities&rdquo; and similarly demanded that the agency end its active operations in Portland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gov. Tina Kotek slammed the Trump Administration during <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJHNJ2Arpd0\"  target=\"_blank\">a press conference Thursday evening</a>, and she demanded a full, transparent investigation into the shooting. She said she has yet to speak to Administration officials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Trust is essential to maintain community safety and uphold the law,&rdquo; Kotek said. &ldquo;Federal agents at the direction of the Department of Homeland Security are shattering trust. They are hurting people and they are destroying day by day what we hold dear: our safety.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>State senator Kayse Jama addressed federal immigration agents directly during the same conference, saying: &ldquo;We do not need you, you are not welcome, you need to get the hell out of our community.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know about the shooting so far.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What happened?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Portland police said they responded to a report of a shooting along Southeast Main Street at 2:18 p.m. Pacific Time, where it was confirmed federal agents were involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Six minutes later, they received information on a man shot, calling and requesting help in the area of Northeast 146th Avenue and East Burnside, some 3 mi. away. Upon responding, police officers found a man and a woman with apparent gunshot wounds. Officers applied a tourniquet and called emergency medical personnel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The victims, who have yet to be officially identified, were then transported to the hospital; their conditions are unknown. An unnamed senior law enforcement official <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-ice-shooting-01-08-26?post-id=cmk6706q700003b6p2vt0yshp\"  target=\"_blank\">told CNN</a> that the two victims were husband and wife&mdash;the man was shot in the arm while the woman was shot in the chest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The FBI&rsquo;s Portland office <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/live-blog/live-updates-woman-fatally-shot-ice-agent-identified-us-citizen-mother-rcna252927/rcrd96064?canonicalCard=true\"  target=\"_blank\">said in a since-revised statement</a> that it was actively investigating an &ldquo;assault&rdquo; on Customs and Border Protection agents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When reached for comment, the White House referred TIME to a <a href=\"https://x.com/TriciaOhio/status/2009429617296461825\"  target=\"_blank\">statement posted on X</a> by DHS Spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin, who explained that U.S. Border Patrol agents were conducting a &ldquo;targeted vehicle stop.&rdquo; McLaughlin&rsquo;s statement claimed that the target was the passenger of the vehicle, a <a href=\"https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/\" >Venezuelan</a> &ldquo;illegal alien&rdquo; allegedly involved in a recent shooting in the city. The passenger was also alleged to be linked to the transnational crime syndicate Tren de Aragua&rsquo;s prostitution ring, while the driver was also &ldquo;believed to be&rdquo; a member of the syndicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When agents identified themselves to the vehicle occupants, the driver weaponized his vehicle and attempted to run over the law enforcement agents,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;Fearing for his life and safety, an agent fired defensive shots,&rdquo; it continued, after which the driver of the vehicle drove off.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why is it notable that the latest shooting occurred in Portland?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Portland has a long history of activism and left-wing protests. But the city has particularly incensed <a href=\"https://time.com/7322038/trump-portland-ice-protests-crime/\" >Trump and other conservatives</a>, since it was a key site for the <a href=\"https://time.com/5868911/portland-protests-law-enforcement-response/\" >Black Lives Matter protest movement in 2020</a> during the President&rsquo;s first term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Trump&rsquo;s return to the White House in 2025, protests against arrests and detentions by immigration agents have become common nationwide, as his Administration ramps up its <a href=\"https://time.com/7319484/immigration-ice-deportation-rural-resistance/\" >mass-deportation</a> campaign, targeting in particular so-called sanctuary cities, <a href=\"https://www.portland.gov/council/districts/3/angelita-morillo/news/2025/8/25/update-ice-portland\"  target=\"_blank\">including Portland</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In September, Trump <a href=\"https://time.com/7321220/trump-portland-troops-antifa-deploy/\" >called</a> the city &ldquo;war-ravaged&rdquo; and claimed that ICE facilities were &ldquo;under siege from attack by Antifa, and other domestic terrorists&rdquo; as he deployed National Guard personnel there. Trump eventually <a href=\"https://www.statesmanjournal.com/story/news/local/oregon/2025/12/31/trump-announces-national-guard-withdrawal-portland-oregon/87977261007/\"  target=\"_blank\">withdrew the Guardsmen in December</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following the shooting in Minneapolis, protests broke out across several cities in the U.S., including <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/08/nx-s1-5671719/ice-shooting-minneapolis-protest\"  target=\"_blank\">in Portland</a>, denouncing ICE&rsquo;s presence in their respective communities. Hours after the Thursday shooting, protesters reportedly <a href=\"https://www.kgw.com/video/news/local/protesters-chant-abolish-ice-after-portland-border-patrol-shooting/283-047d4a3c-7260-401a-8a66-8918bc90d3bd\"  target=\"_blank\">gathered in front of Portland City Hall</a>, calling for the abolition of ICE. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s deployment of federal agents in my hometown is clearly inflaming violence,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://x.com/RonWyden/status/2009421375677845795\"  target=\"_blank\">Sen. Ron Wyden (D, Ore.), posted on X</a>, &ldquo;and must end.&rdquo;</p>\n",

Upon arriving at Cumming&#8217;s castle in the first episode, the group was eager to head to the initial blindfolded round table and find out whether they had been selected to play as a Traitor or Faithful. But this time around, the contestants were immediately thrown for a loop when their host revealed there would be an additional &#8220;Secret Traitor,&#8221; one whose identity was kept hidden from everyone (including those of us watching at home).</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>This twist was introduced in the opening minutes of the premiere and quickly cranked the game into high gear, especially after the three other Traitors&mdash;Real Housewives Lisa Rinna and Candiace Dillard Bassett, and <em>Love Island</em>&#8216;s Rob Rausch&mdash;learned the Secret Traitor was working independently from them and would influence each night&#8217;s &#8220;murder&#8221; by providing them with a<em> </em>shortlist of victims they were allowed to choose from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With Peacock releasing the first three episodes of Season 4 all at once on Thursday, we were dropped into the whodunnit mix right alongside the Faithfuls. Suspicions flared and accusations began to fly, leading to a near-instant feud between <em>Survivor</em> winner Yamil &#8220;Yam Yam&#8221; Arocho and actor Michael Rapaport, and Williams sealing her fate as the first Faithful to be banished from the castle with some unfortunate slips of the tongue. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/The-Traitors-Season-4-Donna-Kelce.jpg\" alt=\"The Traitors - Season 4\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>But the juiciest reveal was still to come. After being called out at the first round table for coming off as quiet and a bit tense, America&#8217;s favorite football mom Donna Kelce&mdash;the mother of NFL stars Jason and Travis Kelce and soon-to-be mother-in-law of Taylor Swift&mdash;was on the chopping block at the start of Episode 3. She spent the time leading up to the second round table and much of the vote discussion on the defensive, arguing her unassuming personality was not Traitor behavior but rather the result of her &#8220;fangirling&#8221; over being there in the first place. As Kelce herself put it, it seemed like &#8220;low-hanging fruit&#8221; for all these reality TV stars to go after a woman with no other connections there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite her pleas, the majority of votes landed on Kelce and she stood to make her exit speech&mdash;only to reveal she was in fact&#8230;a Traitor! Unbeknownst to the Faithfuls, they had caught the Secret Traitor first, surprising even her fellow Traitor cohorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The banishment may have put an end to what could&#8217;ve been a fun, ongoing mystery for viewers to try to solve as the season progressed, but it also felt like it upped the gameplay ante. After all, if this cast is willing to turn on a Swiftie fan favorite so quickly, they&#8217;re hopefully willing to continue taking increasingly big and pulse-pounding swings as the season progresses. </p>\n",

Brief, TIME&rsquo;s politics newsletter. Sign up </em><a href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/signup?nln=dc-brief&amp;source=dc_onsite\" ><em>here</em></a><em> to get stories like this sent to your inbox.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Confused about what, exactly, the United States has planned for <a href=\"https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/\" >Venezuela</a>? You&rsquo;re in very good, mighty large company.</p>\n\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n<p>Around Washington, even those who have gotten briefed by the Trump Administration&rsquo;s most-senior hands overseeing the operation cannot convincingly describe it. The D.C. set lacks a vocabulary to detail what has happened, what is happening, and what they expect to happen next. The problem underlying all three is that none match the known definitions describing past bouts of U.S. ambition abroad. What do you call it when the U.S. <a href=\"https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/\" >seizes the leader</a> of an oil-rich South American nation from his bed and hauls him to Manhattan to face drug charges, but leaves the rest of his leadership <a href=\"https://time.com/7343295/venezuela-machado-trump-nobel-peace-prize/\" >intact</a> and warns them that they better do what he wants? In a first for Donald Trump, he is lacking a slogan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaker Mike Johnson seemed ready to split hairs on Monday after a closed-door session with Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other Trump officials. &ldquo;The way this is being described, this is not a regime change,&rdquo; Johnson said. &ldquo;This is a demand for change of behavior by a regime.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Got that? Yeah, neither does most of Washington.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For his part, appearing Monday in federal court in Manhattan, Venezuela&rsquo;s autocratic leader Nicol&aacute;s Maduro said he had been &ldquo;kidnapped.&rdquo; U.S. officials countered that he was arrested as part of a criminal case against him and his family. Venezuela&rsquo;s allies said it felt all too familiar: &ldquo;It reminds us of the worst interference in our area, in our zone of peace,&rdquo; Columbia&rsquo;s Ambassador to the U.N. said during a fiery emergency session this week. The French representative sitting through that Security Council meeting said Trump&rsquo;s action &ldquo;chips away at the very foundation of international order&rdquo; while U.N. Secretary General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, said the moves violated the U.N. charter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But here&rsquo;s the problem no one can untangle: what, exactly, do we call <em>it</em>?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge here is how all of the potentially appropriate language carries biases with it. <em>Regime Change</em> is synonymous to a lot of Washington with plenty of troubled records in removing one set of leaders for another. (And, to be clear, leaving Maduro&rsquo;s Vice President in charge of the still-intact Maduro government falls far short of that.) <em>Decapitation</em> works only if the body below dies, and that does not seem to have happened; Trump says the new leader is complying with his demands. <em>Regents</em> or <em>viceroys</em> hearken back to royalty and empires, and that&rsquo;s not the look Trump is going for here&mdash;at least for now. And anything bordering on colonial or Cold War language&mdash;<em>protectorate, satellite state, occupied territory, vassal state, provisional government, client</em>&mdash;are pretty much non-starters with the foreign policy establishment that knows these things seldom end well for the bigger power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Scholars of U.S. ambitions are also searching for the right language. &ldquo;It does not seem that Trump is imagining regime change. He would be doing different things if that were the goal,&rdquo; says Daniel Immerwahr, a historian at Northwestern University whose 2019 book, <em>How to Hide an Empire: A History of the Greater United States</em>, seems prescient these days. &ldquo;You could call it an informal empire if you wanted to, like, <em>We will turn you into a protectorate</em>. But that is different from <em>We&#8217;re going to micromanage your internal politics</em>. That is different from <em>We&#8217;re going to try to make you part of us, or like us in some way, or make you over in our image</em>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Dominic Tierney, a Swarthmore College political scientist whose research focuses on wars and their perceptions, put it to me: &ldquo;If any other country made any effort to do that to the United States, it would be considered an act of war, unquestionably.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <em><a href=\"https://time.com/7343792/maduro-nike-tech-tracksuit-visual-power-venezuela/\" >Maduro&rsquo;s Nike Tracksuit and the New Visual Language of Power</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the most simple terms: there is not really a word that fits what just happened. It&rsquo;s not like, to borrow an Immerwahr analogy, the munchkins are ready to greet Dorothy as a liberator for dropping a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. Predictions of Iraqis greeting U.S. forces as liberators to this day haunt the Bush team. The grey zone works in Trump&rsquo;s favor. That&rsquo;s why it has been so easy for Trump&rsquo;s team to talk in circles around what they just accomplished.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;American warriors are second to none, the best in the world and the best of our country,&rdquo; Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://rollcall.com/factbase/trump/transcript/donald-trump-press-conference-venezuela-maduro-january-3-2026/\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> hours after the operation. &ldquo;What all of us witnessed last night was sheer guts and grit, gallantry, and glory of the American warrior. I&#8217;m simply humbled by such men.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next day, appearing on NBC&rsquo;s <em>Meet the Press</em>, Secretary of State and interim National Security Adviser Marco Rubio downplayed the military aspect of the operation. &ldquo;There&#8217;s not a war. I mean, we are at war against drug trafficking organizations, not a war against Venezuela. We are enforcing American laws with regards to oil sanctions,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the following day, after meeting with both Secretaries, Johnson seemed ready to parrot the language. &ldquo;We are not at war. We do not have U.S. armed forces in Venezuela, and we are not occupying that country,&rdquo; the Speaker said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, as he is wont to do, Trump had other messaging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We&rsquo;re at war with people that sell drugs. We&rsquo;re at war with people that empty their prisons into our country and empty their drug addicts and empty their mental institutions into our country,&rdquo; Trump <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/trump-says-us-not-war-venezuela-rcna252427\"  target=\"_blank\">told</a> NBC News that same day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Wednesday, when he sat down for almost two hours with reporters from The New York <em>Times</em>, Trump then <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/us/politics/trump-interview-power-morality.html\"  target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> the U.S. could play a role in Venezuela for years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to be using oil, and we&rsquo;re going to be taking oil. We&rsquo;re getting oil prices down, and we&rsquo;re going to be giving money to Venezuela, which they desperately need,&rdquo; Trump said Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hours later, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Fox News that a U.S. takeover of Venezuelan oil is not happening. &ldquo;No, definitely not. This is Trump being Trump,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is the threat of military force but not the use of military force to prevent the export of Venezuelan crude that&rsquo;s been under sanctions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The ambiguity might be strategic but not without cost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the Senate struggled with its vocabulary as it issued a rare rebuke of Trump&rsquo;s actions in the Southern hemisphere. GOP Sens. Rand Paul of Kentucky, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Todd Young of Indiana, and Josh Hawley of Missouri joined with Democrats to advance largely symbolic <a href=\"https://time.com/7344716/war-powers-act-senate-trump-venezuela/\" >legislation</a> that would require Trump to seek Congress&rsquo; approval before taking any new military action in Venezuela. But notably absent: an actual definition of what was happening beyond calling future actions &ldquo;hostilities.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then there&rsquo;s the murky rationale behind all of this. Trump and his allies have said this is to head off a narco-terrorism operation that threatens Americans, but cannot seem to stop talking about Venezuela&#8217;s oil riches. (&ldquo;You didn&#8217;t say that part out loud,&rdquo; Immerwahr jokes about oil having been an unspoken pretense for past wars.) From the White House, it seems like Trump is already rationing barrels of energy to U.S. firms. Some, like Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, are hailing the move as a first step toward restoring democracy in Venezuela, yet Trump has signaled Maduro&rsquo;s most credible political rival&mdash;the one who won last year&rsquo;s Nobel Peace Prize&mdash;should not be waiting for a phone call installing her, even after she offered to give Trump her award for freeing her nation of Maduro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what might end up coming out of this is a term that is uniquely about Venezuela for the moment&mdash;but one that could be expanded if Trump replicates this nebulous tactic elsewhere. After all, <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/Balkanization\"  target=\"_blank\">Balkanization</a> did not mean anything until the 20th Century. Language is fluid&mdash;and certainly so is Trump&rsquo;s pursuit of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Make sense of what matters in Washington. </em><a href=\"https://cloud.newsletters.time.com/signup?nln=dc-brief&amp;source=dc_onsite\" ><em>Sign up for the D.C.

Vance on Thursday sharply defended the federal immigration agent who shot and <a href=\"https://time.com/7344506/minneapolis-ice-shooting-mayor/\" >killed a woman in Minneapolis</a> and insisted that there was no reason to question the agent&#8217;s actions&mdash;even as video footage and accounts from state and local officials painted a more complicated and contested picture of what happened.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking from the White House briefing room, Vance described the episode as &ldquo;an attack on federal law enforcement&rdquo; and &ldquo;an attack on the American people,&rdquo; arguing that rhetoric from the left had radicalized a small group of activists and placed officers in danger. At times raising his voice, he characterized media coverage questioning the actions of Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents as &ldquo;an absolute disgrace&rdquo; and insisted that the officer involved had acted to save his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is a guy who&rsquo;s actually done a very, very important job for the United States of America,&rdquo; Vance said of the agent, noting that the officer had previously been struck twice by vehicles in the past six months, once suffering injuries that required more than 30 stitches. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s been assaulted, he&rsquo;s been attacked. He&rsquo;s been injured because of it. He deserves a debt of gratitude.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <em><a href=\"https://time.com/7344804/minneapolis-ice-shooting-protests-renee-nicole-good/\" >Protests Erupt After Fatal ICE Shooting in Minneapolis</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Federal officials have said the officer shot 37-year-old Renee Nicole Good after she allegedly used her car as a weapon during what they described as a legitimate law enforcement operation. President Donald Trump reiterated that account on social media, calling the shooting an act of self-defense, while Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem said the woman had been &ldquo;stalking&rdquo; agents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But video footage of the encounter, posted online and verified by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/video/us/100000010631041/minneapolis-ice-shooting-video.html\"  target=\"_blank\">The New York <em>Times</em></a><em> </em>and other outlets, raises questions about how federal officials are describing the incident. The footage shows two federal agents trying to pull Good from a vehicle that was partially blocking a residential street. The car reverses, then pulls forward and begins to turn. A third agent steps into view, draws his gun and fires a shot, then continues firing as the vehicle moves past him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Witnesses have said the shots came almost immediately after an agent shouted &ldquo;Stop.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pressed by reporters on whether he was preempting an investigation that is still in its early stages, Vance dismissed the concern. &ldquo;What you see is what you get in this case,&rdquo; he said, asserting that &ldquo;nobody debates&rdquo; that Good aimed her car at an officer&mdash;a claim that state officials and Democrats have in fact strongly disputed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At one point, Vance said it was a &ldquo;lie&rdquo; to describe Good as &ldquo;some innocent woman,&rdquo; arguing that she had gone to the scene to interfere with federal agents. He went further, alleging without evidence that she was part of a &ldquo;broader left-wing network&rdquo; intent on obstructing, assaulting and doxxing ICE officers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Later, after acknowledging that he had watched the video, Vance softened his certainty slightly, saying he did not know what was in the woman&rsquo;s heart or mind. &ldquo;Was she panicking, or was she actually trying to ram him?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s a reasonable conversation.&rdquo; Even so, he called her death &ldquo;a tragedy of her own making&rdquo; and &ldquo;a tragedy of the far left,&rdquo; saying she must have been &ldquo;brainwashed&rdquo; or &ldquo;radicalized&rdquo; to put herself in that situation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Minneapolis police chief, Brian O&rsquo;Hara, said there was nothing to suggest that Good was the target of any law enforcement investigation. Minnesota officials identified her as the woman killed and said she was not suspected of any crime before the encounter.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-video-jw\">[video id=awESmhWh vertical]</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Almost immediately after Good&rsquo;s death on Wednesday, Minnesota leaders responded with anger and alarm. Democratic Gov. Tim Walz said federal immigration operations had made his state less safe, not more, and accused the Administration of spreading propaganda about the shooting. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t believe this propaganda machine,&rdquo; he <a href=\"https://x.com/GovTimWalz/status/2008980259199394021\"  target=\"_blank\">wrote on social media</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At a news conference on Thursday, Walz described what he called a chilling lack of humanity at the scene, saying a person who identified themselves as a physician was turned away when they tried to provide medical aid. He also said ICE agents later entered a Minnesota school, causing disruptions. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say this strongly enough,&rdquo; Walz said. &ldquo;I beg you, I implore you, to tell them to stay out of our schools.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey called federal accounts of the shooting &ldquo;bulls&mdash;t&rdquo; and described the incident as &ldquo;an agent recklessly using power that resulted in somebody dying.&rdquo; Thousands of people gathered near the site of the shooting for a vigil Wednesday night, chanting against ICE. The scene was about a mile from where George Floyd was killed by police in 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local officials have also raised concerns about whether the government will conduct a fair and accurate investigation into the shooting, after they said Thursday that federal law enforcement were freezing out state investigators from the investigation. The investigation will be led solely by the FBI, according to Drew Evans, the superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shooting comes amid a broader escalation in immigration enforcement nationwide. In the last four months, immigration officers have fired on at least nine people in five states and Washington, D.C., all involving individuals in vehicles, according to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/07/us/minnesota-shooting-ice#ice-shootings-minneapolis-other-cities\"  target=\"_blank\">The New York <em>Times</em></a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same White House appearance on Thursday, Vance announced a separate move targeting Minnesota. He said the White House would soon create a new assistant attorney general position with nationwide jurisdiction to investigate and prosecute fraud, initially focused on allegations that childcare centers in Minnesota had improperly taken federal funds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official, Vance said, would have the resources and authority of a special counsel but would report directly to him and to Trump. He added that Senate Majority Leader John Thune had promised the nominee would receive swift confirmation.</p>\n",

The result is that the president has now withdrawn the United States from a total 66 international organisations, including 31 United Nations entities. Other groups included U.N. Oceans, the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, and the International Renewable Energy Agency.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>In doing so, the United States has become the first country to turn its back on the framework it played a pivotal role in creating in the early 1990s<strong>.</strong> &ldquo;It&#8217;s a terrible signal of the U.S.&rsquo;s commitment to international climate action,&rdquo; says Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director of international climate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. &ldquo;Russia, Iran, Venezuela, countries that are not super strong climate leaders are still party to the agreement. So the U.S. will be the only big outlier in the global international conference.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given that the Trump Administration has already rolled back a number of climate initiatives, experts say that leaving the UNFCCC is unlikely to have a tangible impact.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The federal government, over the last 11 plus months, has already done everything they can to put the brakes on energy transition and climate action,&rdquo; says Max Holmes, president and CEO of the Woodwell Climate Research Center.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move will put the U.S. further behind other countries that are looking to take advantage of the growing clean energy movement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The U.S. is missing out on a huge economic opportunity,&rdquo; says Jake Schmidt, senior strategic director of international climate at the Natural Resources Defense Council. &ldquo;With the Inflation Reduction Act and some of the investments that were starting to come into the U.S. after it, there was a sign that the U.S. could both be a domestic player on clean energy economy and also positioned to potentially export some of those efforts to the rest of the world and play a role in this growing clean energy market. Unfortunately the moves of the Trump Administration is going to make it much harder to compete in this growing clean energy market.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement published on Thursday, Simon Stiell, UNFCCC executive secretary, said that the decision would only hurt the United States in the long run.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;While all other nations are stepping forward together, this latest step back from global leadership, climate cooperation and science can only harm the U.S. economy, jobs, and living standards, as wildfires, floods, mega-storms, and droughts get rapidly worse,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will mean less affordable energy, food, transport, and insurance for American households and businesses, as renewables keep getting cheaper than fossil fuels, as climate-driven disasters hit American crops, businesses, and infrastructure harder each year, and as oil, coal, and gas volatility drives more conflicts, regional instability, and forced migration.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stiell also said that &ldquo;the doors remain open&rdquo; for the U.S. to return to the treaty in the future.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The rest of the world doesn&rsquo;t seem to be waiting around, Schmidt says, noting that the annual U.N. climate conference, dubbed COP30 last year, chugged on without U.S. involvement. &ldquo;&#8203;&#8203;We saw clear signs that the rest of the world is continuing to move forward with climate change action at home&hellip; I think that&#8217;s a sign that the rest of the world is a bit disappointed that the U.S. is sitting out, but it&#8217;s not stopping its own action.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it&rsquo;s game over for climate action in the United States. Across the country, state and local governments have continued to push forward on climate action locally and represent the United States on the international level, notes Holmes. &ldquo;Just because the federal government tries to stop things doesn&#8217;t mean everything stops,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;The U.S. government is by no means the only show in town.&rdquo;</p>\n",

They remain ready in the event they are needed to help keep the peace, ensure public safety, and allow for peaceful demonstrations.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Protesters convened on Thursday outside the Bishop Henry Whipple Federal Building, which holds offices for a number of federal agencies, including an immigration court and the local Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) headquarters. Demonstrators held up signs that read &ldquo;ICE Out Now&rdquo; and &ldquo;We deserve to be safe in our community.&rdquo; Law enforcement officers pushed the crowd farther away from the building, releasing <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/08/us/minnesota-ice-shooting-news.html\"  target=\"_blank\">tear gas</a> and firing <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/us/live-news/minneapolis-ice-shooting-01-08-26?post-id=cmk5i5wal0005356p2bea9a49\"  target=\"_blank\">pepper balls</a> in an attempt to disperse protesters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are peacefully demonstrating,&rdquo; Patrick Riley, who protested outside the building on Thursday, told <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/minneapolis-ice-shooting-updates-1-8-2026#0000019b-9e28-da1d-abdb-feec7f4b0000\"  target=\"_blank\">The Associated Press</a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to let this organization know that they&rsquo;re not welcome.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The previous day, protesters yelled and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/us/video/protesters-pelt-police-with-snowballs-mn-shooting-digvid-vrtc\"  target=\"_blank\">threw snowballs</a> at law enforcement officers at the scene of the shooting and that evening, mourners held a makeshift memorial to honor Renee Nicole Good, who authorities identified as the woman who was shot and killed by an ICE agent earlier on Wednesday.

She claimed the vehicle Good was driving was &ldquo;used as a weapon&rdquo; and said &ldquo;this officer took action to protect himself and to protect his fellow law enforcement officers.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The day before, Noem said that the immigration agent had been &ldquo;dragged&rdquo; by a car in another altercation in June. Noem didn&rsquo;t name the officer, but a department spokesperson <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/minneapolis-ice-shooting-updates-1-8-2026#0000019b-9f0f-dc67-afdf-9f1fd5bd0000\"  target=\"_blank\">confirmed to A</a>P that the June incident the Homeland Security Secretary alluded to had occurred in Bloomington, Minnesota. AP reported that court documents identified the officer in question as Jonathan Ross<em>.</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>City and state leaders have condemned federal officials&rsquo; account of the incident in Minneapolis on Wednesday, with some calling it &ldquo;propaganda.&rdquo; Frey, who told reporters that he had watched video footage of the incident, said that the claim that the shooting was done in self-defense was &ldquo;bullsh-t.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;What I can tell you is the narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative that is not true,&rdquo; he said at a press conference on Wednesday. &ldquo;It has no truth, and it needs to be stated very clearly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Video footage of the incident circulating online shows federal agents going up to a car, with one officer trying to open the door on the driver&rsquo;s side of the vehicle. The car can be seen backing up briefly, and then starting to drive away from the officers. In the footage, another agent appears to pull out his gun and proceeds to fire shots in the direction of the car.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, Drew Evans, said on Thursday that federal officials weren&rsquo;t giving state investigators access to evidence in the incident, which effectively means they can&rsquo;t investigate the shooting. Noem said that state investigators &ldquo;have not been cut out&rdquo; of the investigation, but claimed that they didn&rsquo;t have jurisdiction in this case. The city of Minneapolis <a href=\"https://x.com/CityMinneapolis/status/2009318204300992633\"  target=\"_blank\">released</a> a statement on X in response to the move, calling it &ldquo;deeply disappointing&rdquo; and saying that city officials were &ldquo;concerned that the investigation is proceeding without state partners.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are calling for a clear and transparent process that includes state investigating agencies,&rdquo; the city said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shooting, which took place less than a mile away from the site of George Floyd&rsquo;s killing by a police officer in 2020, sparked widespread outrage. ICE has deployed hundreds of agents to Minnesota recently as part of an immigration crackdown, which many local officials, including Frey, objected to even before the shooting. In the aftermath of Good&rsquo;s killing on Wednesday, many leaders <a href=\"https://time.com/7344506/minneapolis-ice-shooting-mayor/\" >called</a> for ICE to vacate the city.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I have a message for ICE: Get the f-ck out of Minneapolis. We do not want you here,&rdquo; Frey said on Wednesday. &ldquo;Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite. People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart &hellip; and now somebody is dead.&rdquo;</p>\n",

However, this time around, Robby, still-suffering from pandemic-induced PTSD, is one shift away from a three-month leave that he plans to spend on a cross-country motorcycle trip.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;He&rsquo;s created a sort of self-help version of a mental health plan where he could fix up this old motorcycle and take it on this slightly romantic, slightly literary odyssey-trip of self discovery,&#8221; Wyle told the <em><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/pitt-noah-wyle-6a95edd26aef51df73522b52af92caa6\"  target=\"_blank\">Associated Press</a></em> of his character&#8217;s headspace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Robby is (supposedly) on his way out, some fresh faces are navigating their very first day in the fray of the Pitt. Here&#8217;s your guide to the new doctors and nurses popping up in Season 2 of everyone&#8217;s current medical drama fixation.  </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Dr. Baran Al-Hashimi</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gerran-howell-amielynn-abellera-noah-wyle-sepideh-moafi-supriya-ganesh_ac6d25.jpg\" alt=\"Overriding Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi) , Dr. Robby (Noah Wyle) encourages Samira (Supriya Ganesh) and Garcia (Alexandra Metz) through a procedure in 'The Pitt' Season 2.\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With Dr. Robby set to jet off on a three-month-long sabbatical-meets-motorcycle pilgrimage following one final shift, Dr. Baran Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi of <em>The Deuce</em>, <em>The L Word: Generation Q</em>, and <em>Blackbird</em>) has been brought in to take over as PTMC&#8217;s new chief attending physician in his absence. Naturally, the two have some trouble adjusting to each other&#8217;s differing medical philosophies, with Robby preferring to maintain a more old-school approach to running the ER while Al-Hashimi is a proponent of introducing new technological initiatives like &#8220;patient passports&#8221; and AI charting tools. Robby clearly has his hackles up where Al-Hashimi is concerned, but their tension also seems to sometimes border on flirtatious&mdash;even if Moafi claims romance isn&#8217;t necessarily in the cards for the pair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I can assure there will be no broom closets involved,&#8221; she told <em><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2026/01/07/pitt-new-doctor-sepideh-moafi-noah-wyle/87965703007/\"  target=\"_blank\">USA Today</a></em>. &#8220;The way I pictured it when I read the scripts was that we&#8217;re two animals in the wild sort of circling and sniffing each other out. Sometimes they stop and stare, and they&#8217;re curious. That&#8217;s the dynamic. Something explosive, but all under the surface. She&#8217;s used to high stress and men undercutting her. There&#8217;s something about Dr. Robby that&#8217;s unique.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Joy Kwon</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/noah-wyle-irene-choi-fiona-dourif.jpg\" alt=\"Noah Wyle as Dr. Robby, Irene Choi as medical student Joy Kwon, and Fiona Dourif as Dr. McKay in Season 2 of 'The Pitt.'\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Playing by recurring <em>Community</em> guest star Irene Choi&mdash;who has, more recently, appeared in <em>Truth Be Told </em>and <em>Pam &amp; Tommy</em>&mdash;Joy Kwon is a third-year medical student working under the mentorship of Dr. Dennis Whitaker (Gerran Howell) who has a pretty clinical outlook on patient care. That is to say, she doesn&#8217;t seem all that interested in treating them at all. Unfortunately for her, apathy doesn&#8217;t appear to be part of the recipe for a long and successful career at PTMC.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">James Ogilvie</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/gerran-howell-lucas-iverson.jpg\" alt=\"Gerran Howell as Whitaker and Lucas Iverson as Ogilvie in 'The Pitt' Season 2.\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Whitaker&#8217;s other charge, fourth-year med student James Ogilvie (Lucas Iverson, who has appeared in <em>The Gilded Age</em>), comes off as an arrogant know-it-all whose overconfidence and lack of empathy seem like they&#8217;re probably going to end up getting him in trouble. The Pitt definitely feels like the type of workplace where conceited doctors-in-training are pretty much guaranteed to quickly get knocked down a peg.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Emma Nolan</h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/laetitia-hollard.jpg\" alt=\"Laetitia Hollard as Emma in 'The Pitt' Season 2.\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Compared to her medical student counterparts, recent nursing school graduate Emma Nolan (La&euml;titia Hollard in the Juilliard alum&#8217;s first major on-screen role) is a breath of fresh air.

Three women are <a href=\"https://time.com/7019618/essential-true-crime-documentaries/\" >murdered</a> in Dahlonega, Georgia, and the six episodes are all about the search for the culprit. </p>\n\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n<p>Dahlonega is a very small town. Case in point, investigator Jack (Jon Bernthal), and the Atlanta reporter covering the murders, Anna (Tessa Thompson), are married but estranged. The reporter also knew the victims from her preppy high school; they were in the same friend group. Despite these close ties, the identity of the murderer catches her completely by surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about the show&rsquo;s shocking ending.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Small town, big drama</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The show starts with Anna returning to her reporting job at an Atlanta news station after a yearlong leave of absence following the death of her baby, Charlotte, who died suddenly while Anna&rsquo;s mother Alice (Crystal Fox) was babysitting her. For a year, Anna has shut everyone out&mdash;fleeing from her husband and ghosting her mother. Back at work, she is furious that preppy blonde Lexi (Rebecca Rittenhouse) is at the anchor desk in her place. Her boss wants Anna to prove she&rsquo;s worthy of her old job again, so she offers to cover a murder recently reported in her hometown of Dahlonega, in which a young woman was stabbed 40 times in the woods.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She arrives in town at the local hotel with a cameraman who happens to be Lexi&rsquo;s husband Richard (Pablo Schreiber). Jack is surprised that Anna would come all the way from Atlanta to cover the case when he hasn&rsquo;t heard from her in months. But both Jack and Anna care deeply about Anna&rsquo;s mother Alice, who appears to have <a href=\"https://time.com/7005862/how-to-prevent-dementia-cognitive-decline/\" >dementia</a>. It&rsquo;s painful for Anna to watch her mother struggle with daily tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As for Jack, he lives with his sister Zoe (Marin Ireland) and her young daughter. He also has messy ties to the first murder victim, Rachel. They had been having an affair, and Jack even saw Rachel the night she was killed. When recent call logs to her <a href=\"https://time.com/7307163/parent-movement-phone-free-schools/\" >cell phone</a> turn up Jack&rsquo;s number, his deputy Priya (Sunita Mani) starts to wonder if her boss is the murderer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s revealed that Anna knew Rachel in high school, but hasn&rsquo;t been in touch with her. During the investigation, the headmaster of Anna&rsquo;s school, St. Hilary&rsquo;s Academy, is found dead, as well as Jack&rsquo;s sister Zoe. Like Rachel, these women had red friendship bracelets. Turns out Anna had made these friendship bracelets for all of them because they were in the same clique. A falling out is alluded to, but the reason why is kept a mystery for most of the show. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>A turning point comes when Anna and Richard find out their hotel room has been mysteriously cancelled. Richard suggests they go to Lexi&rsquo;s family&rsquo;s lake house nearby, and Anna is shocked to learn that Lexi not only has ties to the area, but was also a member of their clique. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mean girls</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>While looking at family photos on the wall of the lake house, Anna sees photos of her high school classmate Catherine Kelly juxtaposed with photos of the woman Anna knows as Lexi Jones and realizes they are the same person. Viewers see painful flashbacks throughout the show of classmates teasing Kelly about being <a href=\"https://time.com/4501742/if-you-cant-lose-weight-dont-blame-your-genes/\" >overweight</a> and daring her to drink <a href=\"https://time.com/7328589/pee-color-health-insights-urine/\" >urine.</a> But after high school, Kelly had a total body makeover, and that&rsquo;s why Anna never knew that her work nemesis was in her same friend group.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/lexi-jones-his-hers-netflix.jpg\" alt=\"Rebecca Rittenhouse as Lexi in the Netflix thriller 'His and Hers.'\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>All of a sudden, Anna and Catherine&mdash;now Lexi&mdash;are standing face to face in the lake house, and viewers are about to find out the big secret that drove apart Anna and the girls. Anna distanced herself from the clique after her 16th birthday, when Rachel had invited some older guys to meet them in the woods to drink and party. The men sexually assaulted Catherine and Anna.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So while Anna has been mad at Lexi for taking her job, Lexi has been mad at Anna for taking her childhood. &ldquo;You lured me into the woods 20 years ago,&rdquo; Lexi seethes. She resents that Anna kept inviting her to hang out with those women because they <a href=\"https://time.com/5619999/instagram-mosseri-bullying-artificial-intelligence/\" >bullied</a> and <a href=\"https://time.com/19873/bullied-teens-twice-as-likely-to-consider-suicide/\" >abused</a> her. Now, Anna is convinced that Jones killed Rachel and Helen and Zoe to get revenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They end up in a knock-down, drag-out fist fight that ends with them falling backwards into a glass coffee table. Lexi sees a gun laying on the floor nearby, crawls to it, and aims it at Anna, but it&rsquo;s empty. In that moment, detective Priya fatally shoots Lexi, having rushed to the house after making the connection from a yearbook and the trail of friendship bracelets that Anna, Lexi, and the victims all knew each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Jack gets to the scene, Anna explains that she always wanted to tell him about the assault, but didn&rsquo;t know how to approach the subject because his sister Zoe was one of the bystanders. She just decided to move on and pretend it never happened. But the revelation doesn&rsquo;t drive them apart. In fact, it brings them back together.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>An unexpected culprit</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The finale takes place a year later, when Anna is anchoring at the news station while pregnant with another child with Jack, and co-parenting Zoe&rsquo;s daughter with him. They are visiting her mother&rsquo;s house when Anna finds a handwritten note addressed to her. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a huge twist, Alice reveals that she is the one who killed Rachel, Helen, and Zoe. And she&rsquo;s been pretending to have <a href=\"https://time.com/7273212/dementia-murali-doraiswamy-eric-stallard-essay/\" >dementia</a> so that she is not suspected, but her detailed letter shows her memory is &ldquo;as strong as a bear trap,&rdquo; as she puts it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Anna disappeared when Charlotte died under her watch, her mother watched every home movie Anna recorded with her cam-corder throughout her teenage years to feel closer to her daughter. When she found a tape that showed the assault on Catherine and Anna, she decided she had to kill Rachel, Helen, and Zoe. Viewers will see her mother approaching Rachel in the forest&mdash;where she usually met men&mdash;and pushing her on top of the roof of her car, plunging the knife into her repeatedly. Then she slit Helen&rsquo;s throat in her office at the school; she knew her way around because she had worked there as a janitor. And she broke into Zoe&rsquo;s home and killed her while she was taking a bath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Killing Rachel brought you home. Killing Helen kept you here. And killing Zoe gave you the family you lost,&rdquo; Alice wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She figured she could get away with these murders because, as she argues, <a href=\"https://time.com/7291427/murderland-caroline-fraser-interview-serial-killers-lead-theory/\" >serial killers</a> aren&rsquo;t typically <a href=\"https://time.com/7329607/aileen-wuornos-netflix-documentary/\" >women</a> or <a href=\"https://time.com/6295556/gilgo-beach-serial-killers/\" >senior citizens</a>. While she&rsquo;d planned to frame Catherine for the murders, she writes that she wasn&rsquo;t too sad to see that Priya killed her. She says she hoped the killings would demonstrate the power of a mother&rsquo;s love. The show ends with Anna and Alice catching each other&rsquo;s eye and exchanging a smile across the house. This revelation will be their little secret.</p>\n",

Josh Hawley of Missouri, Todd Young of Indiana, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, and Rand Paul of Kentucky. The resolution is set to soon move to the House, where Republicans hold a narrow majority and previously rejected a similar measure. Its prospects there remain uncertain, and even if it were to pass, Trump is expected to veto it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The resolution, brought forward under the War Powers Act and led by Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, would require Trump to seek explicit authorization from Congress before carrying out additional military strikes or sustained operations against Venezuela. It does not retroactively block the raid that led to the capture of President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, but it aims to prevent the Trump Administration from expanding what critics fear could become a prolonged campaign to reshape the Venezuelan government and control its oil resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Constitution is clear&mdash;only Congress can declare war,&rdquo; Paul, a sponsor of the resolution, <a href=\"https://x.com/SenRandPaul/status/2008999337842352524\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> on the Senate floor. &ldquo;Our founder&#8217;s intent is not a close call open to equivocation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <em><a href=\"https://time.com/7344628/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-drugs-war-explainer-questions-answered/\" >What&rsquo;s Happening With the U.S. and Venezuela, Explained</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the War Powers Resolution, passed in 1973 over President Richard Nixon&rsquo;s veto, presidents must notify Congress within 48 hours of deploying U.S. forces and must end hostilities within 60 to 90 days without authorization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vote came one day after all members of Congress received a <a href=\"https://time.com/7344479/venezuela-oil-rubio-trump/\" >classified briefing</a> from top Trump Administration officials on the Venezuela operation, a session that left several lawmakers saying Congress had been kept in the dark as the United States crossed a consequential new threshold overseas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a post on Truth Social, Trump called out the five Republicans who voted to strip his war powers&mdash;saying they &ldquo;should never be elected to office again.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This Vote greatly hampers American Self Defense and National Security, impeding the President&rsquo;s Authority as Commander in Chief,&rdquo; Trump added. &ldquo;In any event, and despite their &lsquo;stupidity,&rsquo; the War Powers Act is Unconstitutional, totally violating Article II of the Constitution, as all Presidents, and their Departments of Justice, have determined before me.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Senate&rsquo;s action followed months of failed attempts to rein in Trump&rsquo;s war powers as his Administration steadily escalated pressure on Venezuela, including repeated strikes on vessels off its coast and sweeping seizures of <a href=\"https://time.com/7343783/oil-companies-response-trump-venezuela/\" >Venezuelan oil</a> shipments. A similar resolution narrowly failed in November, falling short by a 51&ndash;49 margin after only two Republicans backed it. Thursday&rsquo;s vote marked the third time lawmakers confronted the issue on the Senate floor since last year&mdash;and the first time the measure cleared the chamber.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The turning point came after the surprise nighttime raid in Caracas over the weekend, when U.S. forces seized Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, and transported the Venezuelan leader to the United States to face drug and weapons charges. Administration officials have characterized the operation as a law enforcement action, arguing that it falls within the President&rsquo;s authority as commander in chief. But many lawmakers, including some Republicans, said that explanation strained credulity given the scale of the mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several senators said they felt misled by earlier briefings in which administration officials had suggested the United States did not intend to carry out strikes on Venezuelan territory or seek to change its government. Trump&rsquo;s comments that his Administration would run Venezuela for the foreseeable future deepened concerns on Capitol Hill.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <em><a href=\"https://time.com/7344705/venezuela-trump-maduro-regime-change/\" >A Colony? An Occupation? No One Knows What to Call Ve</a></em>nezuela</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senators who backed the resolution said they were particularly worried about the possibility that the Venezuela operation could serve as a precedent for future actions, including against Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark and a NATO ally. Trump has repeatedly floated the idea of asserting U.S. control over Greenland, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt has said that military action is &#8220;always an option at the Commander in Chief&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thursday&rsquo;s Senate vote was framed as an attempt to draw a clear constitutional line before such scenarios materialize.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senator Young, one of five Republicans who backed the resolution, said his vote was &ldquo;about potential future military action, not completed successful operations.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The President and members of his team have stated that the United States now &lsquo;runs&rsquo; Venezuela,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;It is unclear if that means that an American military presence will be required to stabilize the country. [I am] not prepared to commit American troops to that mission.&rdquo;</p>\n",

What happens when a close ally that supplies energy to the country might no longer be able to do so?  </p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. is pressuring Delcy Rodriguez, who was sworn in as Venezuela&#8217;s president, to halt oil supplies to Cuba, which has been receiving about 35,000 barrels of oil daily from Venezuela in late 2025. The seizure of Venezuela-linked <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/u-s-seizes-2-sanctioned-oil-tankers-linked-to-venezuela-in-the-north-atlantic-and-the-caribbean\"  target=\"_blank\">oil tankers</a> in the North Atlantic and the Caribbean by the U.S. forces has increased uncertainty about shipments from Caracas to Havana.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Cuba, this uncertainty is not abstract. It is about fuel for power plants, transport, and basic services. Still, Venezuela is a stress test. The real root cause of Cuba&#8217;s crisis is its weak domestic model. Cuba faces a double crisis: an internal crisis of rules, incentives, and legitimacy, and an external crisis of dwindling support and harsher constraints.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The twin crises of Cuba</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The scale of the tragedy is hard to overstate. Cuba&#8217;s economy is about 15% smaller than it was in 2018. Tourism, a major source of hard currency for the country, remains far below pre-pandemic levels; analyses using <a href=\"http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2025/12/18/cuba-proyecta-un-crecimiento-del-1-del-pib-para-2026/\"  target=\"_blank\">official Cuban data</a> show that tourist arrivals in 2025 were less than half the number in 2019. Electricity generation has fallen sharply: the 2025 <a href=\"http://www.cubadebate.cu/noticias/2025/12/18/cuba-proyecta-un-crecimiento-del-1-del-pib-para-2026/\"  target=\"_blank\">output</a> was roughly 25% lower than in 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The social indicators are even more alarming because they reveal the breakdown of basic state capacity. Cuba&#8217;s infant mortality rate&mdash;once a flagship achievement&mdash;has <a href=\"https://salud.msp.gob.cu/?p=45568&amp;doing_wp_cron=1767409812.9447450637817382812500\"  target=\"_blank\">risen steeply</a> from around 4 per 1,000 live births in 2018 to more than 9 per 1,000 in 2025. The medical workforce has shrunk at a shocking pace: <a href=\"https://www.onei.gob.cu/sites/default/files/publicaciones/2025-09/19-salud-publica-y-proteccion-social_aec2024.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">official statistics</a> show the number of registered physicians fell from 106,131 in 2021 to 75,364 by the end of 2024, a 29% decline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are not just bad outcomes. They are signs of a system that no longer protects what it must and no longer delivers what it promises. When people cannot plan a week ahead&mdash;because power cuts, transport, and basic supplies are unstable&mdash;the economy becomes brittle. When institutions struggle to provide routine services, the state loses authority, even among citizens who avoid politics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This brings us to the internal half of the crisis: Cuba&#8217;s model has become a machine for discouraging initiative and avoiding accountability. Economically, the system still treats private production as something to control rather than something to grow. The private sector has been allowed to expand, then pulled back, repeatedly, leaving entrepreneurs and professionals with a simple lesson: don&#8217;t build too much, don&#8217;t plan too far ahead, and always keep an exit option. That&#8217;s not how development happens. That&#8217;s how informality spreads, and productivity dies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Politically, the concentration of power and lack of transparency and accountability are not only moral issues; they are performance issues. Without open debate, independent associations, and real feedback loops, policy errors last longer, competence is harder to reward, and failure is easier to hide. Over time, the system loses talent, and the state becomes less capable even as the crisis becomes more complex. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let us now consider the external half of Cuba&rsquo;s crisis. The Cuban leadership has long relied on a familiar pattern: when conditions get tight at home, seek relief abroad. In the past, that relief came from Soviet subsidies, later from Venezuelan oil, and more recently from limited support from partners like Russia, China, and Mexico.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuba has squandered the goodwill of governments across the ideological spectrum. Instead of treating external support as a bridge toward transformation, it has repeatedly relied on special arrangements to preserve mere survival. Today&rsquo;s global environment is less forgiving. The outside world is changing, and Cuba is entering it with weak institutions and few buffers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why a disruption in Venezuela is so dangerous. Experts <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/d859d893-1e2a-4ae6-a3d4-c9c505954f16?accessToken=zwAAAZud47-ZkdPYWdiTHipK5tOj1MnFBZVPFg.MEYCIQC6yVfqmToPyG2j-l3zHSNNlU72BV-cHeaj7gL_k3Ws_wIhAOg-1xOfm2kTR2Yw3IntyhscJ5OMWmWC3pHHnLVVOfWR&amp;segmentId=e95a9ae7-622c-6235-5f87-51e412b47e97&amp;shareType=enterprise&amp;shareId=b2e5fdae-a171-4aa8-b6eb-afc42b867c0f\"  target=\"_blank\">estimate</a> that Cuba&#8217;s current oil demand is slightly over 100,000 barrels per day; if a quarter to a third of that depends on Venezuela, a major interruption could push the country toward a subsistence zone, especially because Cuba cannot readily replace that volume through cash purchases.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254343102.jpg\" alt=\"CUBA-VENEZUELA-US-CONFLICT-CRISIS\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The way forward for Havana</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If the diagnosis begins with the model, the solution must also begin there. No outside actor can &ldquo;fix&rdquo; Cuba in place of Cubans. Any approach built on that illusion will backfire. The only durable path forward is a Cuban-led redesign&mdash;supported, not substituted, from the outside. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What would a workable &ldquo;New Cuba&rdquo; look like in practical terms? Not as a slogan, but as a set of basic components that address the failures revealed by the numbers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, Cuba needs legitimacy and accountability in governance. Cuba doesn&rsquo;t need cosmetic reforms or controlled elections that change little. It requires institutions that reflect the country&rsquo;s real diversity and enable the peaceful correction of policy mistakes. That means clearer limits on power, robust checks, and rules that allow citizens to participate without fear&mdash;through civic groups, professional associations, independent media, and local initiatives. A government that asks people to endure hard economic adjustments cannot rely solely on control; it must earn consent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second, Cuba needs to move to a productive economy with rules that make effort pay. Cuba needs to provide lawful enterprise space to operate: stable permissions, predictable taxation and regulation, clearer property and contract rules, and the ability to reinvest, import, export, hire, and grow. This does not require abandoning the social commitment many Cubans still value. Without growth, social guarantees become empty; without a basic social floor, reforms lose public support and can turn unstable. The objective is not to copy any foreign model but to build a Cuban mixed system that rewards work and talent while protecting basic dignity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A third component of renewing and transforming Cuba is a professional state. Cuba&#8217;s crisis is not only ideological&mdash;it is about state capability. Energy policy cannot be managed as propaganda. Fiscal policy cannot be managed as improvisation. Public health cannot be sustained when inputs are missing, and professionals leave. Cuba requires transparent budgeting, credible statistics, and a public administration in which performance matters. These are the minimum conditions for a functional state.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, Cuba must treat national reunification as a development strategy rather than a political concession. The diaspora is not a problem to manage; it is a national asset&mdash;capital, skills, networks, and a bridge to markets. A New Cuba should create safe, legal channels for the diaspora to invest, partner, and participate in public life without permanent suspicion. Many countries have followed this path to rebuild after long decline: by making their diasporas a part of the national recovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, the Cuban system has offered little evidence that it can solve concrete problems&mdash;or, more importantly, carry out the transformations required to make it work. Even some of its most prominent allies allies have <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/9ca0a495-d5d9-4cc5-acf5-43f42a9128b4\"  target=\"_blank\">complained</a> in recent years about its clear inability to implement reforms that would make the economy productively viable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The official Cuban narrative is often saturated with references to external causes of the crisis&mdash;with American sanctions as the preferred target&mdash;and refuses to acknowledge the outright <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/world/americas/cuba-economy-venezuela-oil.html\"  target=\"_blank\">failure of its economic model</a> and the domestic drivers of the national crisis. In doing so, the Cuban government creates a harmful imbalance in how these two dimensions are described and weighed. The result is that too little time and political capital are devoted to changing what is actually under the government&#8217;s direct control.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Of Havana and Washington</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>How shall the United States approach Cuba? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Geography and history ensure that the U.S. policy will shape Cuba&#8217;s context, but it should not feed the illusion that Cuba&rsquo;s future will be directed from abroad. That posture strengthens hardliners inside Cuba and invites overconfidence outside it. Washington would be wiser to avoid actions that close space for Cuban-led change, and to calibrate its policies, instead, to encourage steps that expand Cubans&#8217; real autonomy: the autonomy to work and earn legally, to build businesses, to communicate without constraint, to associate, and to hold institutions accountable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In practice, this means abandoning reflexes. Pressure with no credible pathway to change can harden control and deepen Cuba&#8217;s dependence on whichever patrons are still willing to underwrite and subsidize its stagnation. Engagement without benchmarks can become a reward for inertia. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is, in fact, a third way&mdash;one that demands both patience and precision. Washington should keep the focus on Cuban society and coax Havana toward incremental reforms: the kind that create room for legal economic activity and basic civic life, while constraining the opportunities for rent extraction that closed systems create. That would nudge open the cracks through which change might eventually arrive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The turmoil in Venezuela should be read as a warning against two fantasies: that a foreign ally can rescue Cuba without deep reforms, and that external pressure alone will produce a satisfactory outcome. The economic data suggest that the old operating system is failing, and postponing a redesign of governance and the economy entails increasing costs for Cuba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuba is not short of pride, talent, or civic capacity. It is short of rules that allow its assets to work. The root cause of Cuba&rsquo;s tragedy is Cuban; the remedy for Cuba will be Cuban, too. External shocks may accelerate the timeline, but they do not determine the outcome. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Only Cubans can do that&mdash;by rebuilding a state that deserves trust and an economy that finally gives people a reason to stay, invest, and live with dignity. There are no guarantees, but whatever agency remains must be leveraged to begin national renewal now.<br></p>\n",

She won back-to-back X Games gold medals, in 2024 and 2025, plus the 2025 World Championship, her third world title.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December, Kim set aside a few minutes to talk to TIME about expectations for the Milano Cortina Olympics, why she took a mental-health break and went to therapy after Beijing, and her pets. She&rsquo;s had a whirlwind couple of days, taking a red-eye flight from Los Angeles to Cleveland to surprise her boyfriend, Browns defensive lineman<a href=\"https://www.clevelandbrowns.com/news/myles-garrett-and-denzel-ward-earn-pro-bowl-honors\"  target=\"_blank\"> Myles Garrett</a>, for his game against the Buffalo Bills, then flying back the next morning to continue her prep for Italy.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I sleep really well on planes,&rdquo; says Kim, whose Olympic halfpipe final&mdash;appointment viewing&mdash;takes place on Feb. 12. &ldquo;So I actually feel very rested.&rdquo; </p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>(This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity).&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What&#8217;s the state of Chloe Kim these days?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have no complaints.

What else? I think there&#8217;s been a lot of fun new additions into my life. I got a horse a couple years ago. I just got a pet snake. My dog is so spirited, even though she&#8217;s 9. So I just feel like everyone in my life is doing well, and everything&#8217;s looking really good. So I have nothing to worry about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://time.com/7328290/lindsey-vonn-olympics-comeback-interview/\" ><em>Inside Lindsey Vonn&#8217;s Unprecedented Attempt at an Olympic Comeback</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&rsquo;ve got to ask about the horse and the pet snake. What kind of horse is it? Do you ride it a lot?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s an Arabian. He&#8217;s very sweet. He&#8217;s a chestnut. He&#8217;s just such a cutie patootie. I used to board him near my house, but I ended up moving him, actually, back to the people I got him from. They had moved from Arizona to Temecula. So I have him there. I rode him quite a bit when I first got him, but I got a pretty young horse, so he was a bit unpredictable. So when I got a bit closer to this season, I decided to not ride him as much. So nothing stupid happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>I&#8217;m sure your coaches and agent and sponsors appreciate that.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my trainer was like, &ldquo;You are absolutely not riding that horse until you&#8217;re done with the Olympics.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>And the pet snake, how did you get him or her and what is his or her name? What kind of snake is it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her name is Jelly Bean. She&#8217;s a ball python. I actually got her from my friend. She came over with a bunch of baby snakes and was kind of telling me that she was rehoming them. She had gotten them from someone who didn&rsquo;t want them anymore. I never thought I&#8217;d get a snake. But I felt little Jelly Bean, and I was like, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, I feel this connection with this snake.&rdquo; Which is like the craziest thing ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where do you keep the snake?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s in his massive enclosure, in this tank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>In your house?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Has it ever escaped from its big enclosure?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, she has gotten out, but they typically will just go to another dark, warm area. So I found her right under her enclosure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>More news that your agent, sponsors, and fans are happy to hear.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More:</strong> <a href=\"https://time.com/7341942/alex-maia-shibutani-olympics-2026-comeback-interview/\" ><em>The Shibutanis Left Competitive Ice Dancing for 7 Years.

You won a second snowboarding gold medal at the Beijing Games&mdash; and had a tough time mentally after those Games too. What was difficult for you about that time?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beijing was just challenging in itself. It was <a href=\"https://time.com/6140992/beijing-olympics-china-covid-19/\" >during COVID</a>. It wasn&#8217;t like the most ideal circumstances. Family couldn&#8217;t be there. Friends couldn&#8217;t be there. No one could be there. By the time I came back home, I had already kind of experienced all the waves of emotion, and I spiraled into another depression. It&#8217;s really hard to describe and explain. We are so focused on this one thing for such an extended period of time. When it&#8217;s over, it&#8217;s very strange. </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chloe-kim-milan-olympics-2026-01.jpg\" alt=\"PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You have </strong><a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/olympics/2025/12/05/chloe-kim-myles-garrett-mental-health-2026-olympics/87610116007/\"  target=\"_blank\"><strong>mentioned doing intensive therapy</strong></a><strong> after those Olympics. How did that help you get to a place where you&rsquo;re now happier than ever?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was just a lot of unresolved trauma that I was dealing with. There was just a lot that I was holding on to. So it was nice to kind of let it out. You kind of have to go back to the root of all the things. The reason why I wanted to go to therapy initially was because I didn&#8217;t necessarily like the person I was becoming. I didn&#8217;t like the way I started treating people, the way I viewed some of my relationships. I just felt a little ashamed of who I&#8217;d become. That&#8217;s such a terrible feeling, especially when I should feel like I&#8217;m on top of the world. &#8203;&#8203;The way I&#8217;ve been able to support and show up for people I care about, that kind of started to go away after a while. And I didn&#8217;t like that. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How were you treating people?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt so judged since I was young, and I dealt with so much criticism growing up that I think I started to project that onto others for no reason. That&#8217;s something I&#8217;m still working on actively. I think that I have become so much happier once I started to also create space for myself and set boundaries and say no to a lot of things. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love playing video games. I love just hanging and chilling with my friends, cooking with friends, watching movies with friends. I already travel so much for my sport and have other obligations that when I would come home and I had more stuff to do, whether it would be shoots or endorsements or whatever, I had such little time for myself. And that&#8217;s what made me such an angry person. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve accomplished so much in your sport. You&rsquo;re already the </strong><a href=\"https://www.nbcolympics.com/news/chloe-kim-meet-athlete#:~:text=Kim%20has%20two%20Olympic%20gold,gold%20medals%20at%20the%20Olympics.\"  target=\"_blank\"><strong>only female snowboarder</strong></a><strong> to ever win back-to-back Olympic gold medals in the halfpipe. What keeps you coming back?</strong> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s so much more I want to do. And I&rsquo;ll be honest, I really didn&rsquo;t like my performance in Beijing. I didn&#8217;t think I did a good job. And I&#8217;m very appreciative of the judges for thinking I did OK. I did have a really good run and it makes sense that I won that event. But also, I wouldn&#8217;t have been surprised if I didn&#8217;t.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m really happy with the way that I&#8217;m riding. I&#8217;m really happy that I decided to keep going for it and seeing how far I could go. Last season, I landed a double cork for the first time in competition. [<em>A double cork is </em><em>two off-axis flips combined with spins. It&rsquo;s a complex aerial maneuver.</em>] That was a trick that I never thought I&#8217;d be able to do. It&#8217;s kind of surreal being able to do those things. I thought I had completely maxed out. Turns out I didn&#8217;t. There&#8217;s so much that I could still achieve and do. Those are some of the reasons why I keep coming back. I keep surprising myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So is the goal this time to win without any doubt? What&#8217;s your ideal performance in Italy?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m thinking about winning so much. Not to humblebrag, but I&#8217;m quite satisfied with the two golds that I have already. There&#8217;s so much amazing emerging talent, it&#8217;ll just be such an honor to compete with the next generation. I just want to be satisfied with the way I&#8217;m riding. I just wasn&#8217;t satisfied in Beijing. I never want to feel that again. I hate that feeling. It felt terrible. I&#8217;m looking at my gold medal, and I feel like I don&#8217;t deserve it because I didn&#8217;t do a good job.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/chloe-kim-milan-olympics-2026-03.jpg\" alt=\"Toyota US Grand Prix - Snowboard Halfpipe Final\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you still feel that way when you look at it?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m not like, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, I&#8217;m amazing.&rdquo; My <a href=\"https://time.com/5151999/chloe-kim-gold-olympics-2018/\" >first gold medal</a>, I was like, &ldquo;Oh my gosh, this is so cool.

So I&#8217;m hoping that going into my third, regardless of the outcome, I can just look back and be really proud of myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;re only 25, but do you feel different aches and pains that you might not have felt when you were 17 going into the PyeongChang Olympics?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel pain now. When I was like 17, I would take the most disgusting fall and be totally fine and just get back up and do it again. Even the fall I took in Copper [<em>Kim injured herself before a competition at Copper Mountain, in Colorado, in mid-December and sat it out</em>], if I did that at 17, I probably would have been fine. But now it&#8217;s, &ldquo;Oh, man, I don&#8217;t think my shoulder was at a good angle for it to hit that way. And my ribs are sore.&rdquo; Yeah, I feel like I got hit by a truck.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Have you been to Italy before?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I went once to go shopping. I think it was right after PyeongChang. That was as crazy as I got over there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>So this will be your first time competing in Italy?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, I was competing with the other people in the store for a purse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>What about Italy are you most looking forward to experiencing?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Italian cuisine is one of my favorite foods. I love pizza, pasta, I love all of that. So I think I&#8217;ll be eating good out there. That&#8217;s for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Do you like red wine, the Italian wines? Or do you stay away from that stuff?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if that&#8217;s where my youth is showing, but I&#8217;m not a big wine person yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A few weeks back, in late November, you and your boyfriend, Cleveland Browns defensive end Myles Garrett, </strong><a href=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/articles/myles-garrett-chloe-kim-had-141534861.html\"  target=\"_blank\"><strong>shared a kiss</strong></a><strong> in front of the cameras before a game. You and he had made a few public appearances, but that moment sort of officially confirmed that the two of you were dating. Did you guys plan on intentionally going public that day? Or did it sort of just happen?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ve never really been in a public relationship. So I think I&#8217;ve always been a little scared of it. But I did not know that that was going to happen. I think it was a really sweet thing. No one&#8217;s mad about it. Which is a good start. I don&#8217;t think we were trying super hard to keep it private. But it wasn&#8217;t something we wanted to blast publicly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We just did our thing. We didn&#8217;t really think too much about it, but now that it&#8217;s out, it&#8217;s whatever. Nothing is going to change. We&#8217;re very happy. We&#8217;re just going to keep supporting each other.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>You were just in Cleveland for one of his games. What is that experience like?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was so surprised. That was my first time successfully surprising him. Me and his mom were scheming for a couple of weeks. So it was really fun, awesome to see it all come to life. I wasn&#8217;t necessarily a football fan before, but now I&#8217;m all about it. And, man, the fans in Cleveland are so wonderful. They&#8217;re just so supportive, and they love it. It&#8217;s always fun to be around that type of energy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Is he planning on coming to Italy? The Browns</strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/BrownsCBS/posts/the-browns-have-officially-been-eliminated-from-the-playoffs/1325691669585953/\"  target=\"_blank\"><strong> can&rsquo;t make the Super Bowl,</strong></a><strong> to be fair.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. He&rsquo;s planning to come. Now it&#8217;s his turn to support me. I&rsquo;ve been there for him all fall and some of winter. Now it&#8217;s his turn. [<em>Laughs</em>].</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Well, he could do worse than going to an</strong><a href=\"https://www.olympics.com/en/milano-cortina-2026/territories/livigno\"  target=\"_blank\"><strong> Italian resort town</strong></a><strong> in February, though I heard it will be cold.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just bought him some snow boots, which was a challenge in itself, to find a men&#8217;s size-16 snow boot. But I managed to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>When it comes to these specific Olympics, what are you most excited about?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of things. I love Italy, I love the culture, I love the food. I think it&#8217;ll be really nice to be in that environment. I&#8217;m also staying with my family this time around. I think that&#8217;ll be really fun. And I feel really chill going into it. I know what to expect now going into my third Games. So I feel really good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Any new tricks we should expect?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do have a couple new tricks up my sleeve that I won&#8217;t be sharing. That&#8217;s never going to change. So you&#8217;ll have to tune in to see them.</p>\n",

This quantitative study aims to celebrate and recognize the enduring influence of American brands and companies on American culture, economy, and society.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The list of <strong>&#8220;<a href=\"https://time.com/7339929/americas-most-iconic-companies/\" >America&rsquo;s Most Iconic Companies 2026</a>&#8220;</strong> is a comprehensive analysis that seeks to identify entities that have not only achieved commercial success but have also become deeply ingrained in the American identity, shaping perceptions, habits, and aspirations.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>To be considered for the ranking, a company must have been founded and be headquartered in the United States, with a market presence of at least 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The study is based on an independent survey of more than 10,000 members of the U.S. general population. Respondents were invited to evaluate &#8220;iconic&#8221; companies from a longlist of relevant American companies and their brands (additional nominations were supported), resulting in the collection of over 100,000 individual assessments. The survey was conducted online during July and August 2025. Additional in-depth research was conducted to verify companies&#8217; eligibility based on entry criteria and market presence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey included the following assessment criteria:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>High Recognition and Familiarity:</strong> The ability to identify a company based on its visual elements, such as its logo, colors, or packaging, without explicitly seeing the company name.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Cultural Significance and Impact:</strong> The extent to which a company&#8217;s actions, values, products, or presence influence the beliefs, behaviors, and social norms of a community or society.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Emotional Connection:</strong> The strong feeling or bond individuals develop with a company based on positive experiences, shared values, or trust.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Resilience:</strong> The company&rsquo;s capacity to adapt to and overcome challenges, including market shifts, internal changes, or external disruptions.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Americanness:</strong> A qualitative judgment of how strongly a company&#8217;s brand, culture, operations, and market presence reflect traits commonly associated with U.S. business identity. This criterion synthesizes signals such as origin, governance, communication style, design ethos, and public perception to gauge the company&rsquo;s perceived &#8220;Americanness,&#8221; rather than relying on strict legal or geographic status.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Once the data was collected and evaluated, it was consolidated and weighted within a scoring model. The final score was calculated as follows: 80% of survey results + 20% of market presence. The process of creating the final list included expert verification and quality checks. The 250 companies with the highest scores were ranked and featured on the <strong>&#8220;America&#8217;s Most Iconic Companies 2026&#8221;</strong> list by TIME and Statista.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/7339929/americas-most-iconic-companies/\" >See the full list.</a></p>\n",

The Russian-flagged tanker in the North Atlantic was the Marinera, previously known as Bella 1. It was apprehended by U.S. forces as it traveled through waters between Iceland and Scotland. The United Kingdom assisted the U.S. with its seizure of the Marinera, which had journeyed from the Caribbean Sea and was seemingly heading towards Russia. </p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>U.K. Defence Secretary John Healey said the British involvement in the seizure of the oil tanker was &ldquo;in full compliance with international law,&rdquo; citing how it had previously breached U.S. sanctions on Iran. In July 2024, when the tanker was still known as Bella 1, the U.S. sanctioned it, accusing the vessel of being involved in the transportation of illicit cargo for a company owned by the militant group <a href=\"https://time.com/6324011/hezbollah-israel-lebanon-hamas-war/\" >Hezbollah</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt described the tanker as a &ldquo;Venezuelan shadow fleet vessel deemed stateless after flying a false flag&rdquo; and cited it had a &ldquo;judicial order&#8221; against it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This ship, with a nefarious history, is part of a Russian-Iranian axis of sanctions evasion which is fuelling terrorism, conflict, and misery from the Middle East to Ukraine,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/uk-provides-support-to-us-seizure-of-bella-1-accused-of-shadow-fleet-activities-and-iran-sanctions-breaches\"  target=\"_blank\">Healey told</a> the U.K. Parliament.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.K.&rsquo;s assistance in the seizure of a tanker that has links to Russia, Iran, and Venezuela has prompted much discussion, especially considering the charged geopolitical landscape at play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what we know so far about how the U.K. came to be involved, to what extent they assisted the U.S., and why it&rsquo;s significant.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Britain provided RAF surveillance craft and a naval support vessel</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Ministry of Defence has debriefed Parliament&mdash;and, by extension, the British public&mdash;on the U.K.&rsquo;s involvement in the naval operation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.K. provided pre-planned operational support following a U.S. request for assistance, and allowed U.S. aircraft to use bases to prepare for and carry out the mission.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.royalnavy.mod.uk/organisation/units-and-squadrons/tankers/rfa-tideforce\"  target=\"_blank\">RFA Tideforce, a British tanker,</a> also supported the U.S. military, while the RAF (Royal Air Force) provided vital &ldquo;surveillance support from the air.&rdquo; Operating solely in an assistance capacity, no British troops boarded the seized tanker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Healey heralded the successful operation and the collaborative efforts that saw the detailed plans come to fruition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The U.S. is the U.K.&rsquo;s closest defense and security partner and the security of the North Atlantic is critical to both our homelands,&rdquo; said Healey. &ldquo;The depth of our defense relationship with the U.S. is an essential part of our security, and today&rsquo;s seamlessly executed operation shows just how well this works in practice.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In reference to the Russian-flagged tanker, the U.K. government emphasized that &ldquo;deterring and disrupting the Russian shadow fleet&rdquo; remains a top priority. Thus far, the U.K. has imposed sanctions on 520 Russian shadow fleet vessels.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/AP26008066465878.jpg\" alt=\"US Venezuela\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>British involvement in tanker mission comes after U.K. government distanced itself from Trump&rsquo;s Venezuela operation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>British Prime Minister Keir Starmer was quick to comment on the U.K.&rsquo;s lack of involvement following Trump&rsquo;s controversial operation in Caracas, Venezuela, last weekend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The U.K. was not involved, in any way, in this operation,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKwMSBG6II4\"  target=\"_blank\">said Starmer</a>, expressing his desire to discuss the matter with Trump. Starmer added that, while the facts need to be established, his position is clear. &ldquo;I always say, and believe, we should all uphold international law,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the U.K. didn&rsquo;t hesitate to assist the U.S. when it came to the shadow fleet vessel floating northwest of Britain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew Gawthorpe, senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Centre in London, says the U.K. involvement in this mission was likely &ldquo;a no-brainer&rdquo; for Starmer and the Ministry of Defence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This vessel is accused of violating the <a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/694272f08f4636fa2c547d45/Iran.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">sanctions regime</a> against Iran. The U.K. is a party to that sanctions regime,&rdquo; Gawthorpe says, adding that &ldquo;this was a more routine sanctions enforcement mission,&rdquo; as opposed to the complex issue regarding Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gawthorpe says the collaboration in the North Atlantic is one of great importance and will likely only strengthen the <a href=\"https://time.com/7318214/trump-starmer-us-uk-tech-prosperity-deal-signed/\" >relationship between Starmer and Trump</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The vessel assistance signals to Trump that the U.K. is capable of providing support to the U.S. and that Europeans can help carry out global defense roles,&rdquo; he continues. &ldquo;Starmer can then [hopefully] buy some goodwill with Trump on other issues, such as Ukraine.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The potential fallout between Russia and the U.K.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout Russia&rsquo;s invasion of Ukraine, Downing Street has maintained strong support for Kyiv, positioning itself as one of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&rsquo;s primary allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.K. is a lead force within the <a href=\"https://time.com/7314566/zelensky-trump-ukraine-america-security-guarantees-russia-conflict/\" >Coalition of the Willing</a> alliance in support of Ukraine. Earlier this week, Starmer committed to having British troops on the ground in Ukraine, should a peace deal come to fruition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gawthorpe says the capture of the Russian-flagged tanker, and the U.K.&rsquo;s enthusiastic support of that, has provided Starmer &ldquo;an opportunity to send a message, at a relatively low cost and risk, that the U.K. is steadfast in standing against Russia.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given the ongoing uncertainty over NATO&rsquo;s stability following Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://time.com/7344147/greenland-denmark-trump-takeover-independence-purchase-military-nato/\" >renewed interest</a> in annexing Greenland, and disagreements within the E.U. over the potential use of frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine&rsquo;s war efforts, any semblance of strength is welcome right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Starmer will have calculated &lsquo;how do I advance my conception of what the U.K.&#8217;s core interests are here?&rsquo; Such as trying to crack down on Russian financing and trying to signal the solidarity of the Western alliance,&rdquo; Gawthorpe says. &ldquo;This capture will help send that message.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Moscow has condemned the seizure of the vessel sailing under its flag and has instructed the U.S. to allow any onboard Russians to return home immediately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A statement by the Foreign Ministry on Thursday claimed the seizure was a &ldquo;gross violation of the fundamental principles and norms of international maritime law.&rdquo; It further claimed that U.S. authorities had been repeatedly informed of the vessel&#8217;s &ldquo;Russian identity and its civilian, peaceful status.&rdquo;</p>\n",

Within those years, the country has built a legacy as an incubator of globally relevant companies and brands, and an economic powerhouse. To paint a picture of that business legacy, TIME and Statista conducted a nationally representative survey of U.S. residents to rank the 250 American companies that are not only commercially successful, but have played a vital role in shaping culture and society. The list shows a comprehensive landscape of companies founded just 30 years after the country itself (Colgate-Palmolive in 1806) as well as 21st century entrants (OpenAI in 2015), many of which are already <a href=\"https://time.com/collections/worlds-best-brands/\" >internationally recognized</a>.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://time.com/7334596/americas-most-iconic-companies-methodology/\" ><strong>Methodology: How TIME and Statista Determined America&#8217;s Most Iconic Companies</strong></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;For a long time, there had been a kind of fascination with the culture and the things that happened here in America, because America itself was kind of branded as this special place. There was a story around immigrants and the welcoming of people to this beautiful country to realize their dreams,&rdquo; says Americus Reed, a professor of marketing at University of Pennsylvania&rsquo;s Wharton School. &ldquo;The mechanics of this is that when you invite the brightest and the best to come to one place, you get this bastion of creativity. You get innovation. And you can see that being infused in the brands, the products, services, organizations that start here.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ford Motor Company, which tops the list, has long aligned its brand with the American identity. Known for making cars <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6598181/driving-force-henry-ford/\" >accessible to the masses</a> by bringing down production costs through the assembly line and distributing it across the U.S. via a locally-based dealer-franchise system, Ford transformed the manufacturing process and also transportation for the average American, reshaping the development of cities and suburbs. Now, it&rsquo;s being put in a position to redefine the future of mobility in the country, as it experiments with self-driving cars, and works to <a href=\"https://www.fromtheroad.ford.com/us/en/articles/2025/ford-affordable-electric-vehicle-platform-midsize-electric-truck\"  target=\"_blank\">bring down prices</a> on its <a href=\"https://time.com/collection/time100-companies-2022/6159490/ford/\" >electric vehicles</a>. &ldquo;Just as my great-grandfather put the world on wheels to give people the freedom of movement, our approach to the modern era is rooted in that same spirit. Innovation is not just about building batteries or technology for its own sake; it is about making people&rsquo;s lives better,&rdquo; says Bill Ford, Ford&rsquo;s Executive Chair. &ldquo;We are leveraging our position as the largest hourly auto employer in the U.S. to ensure that the future of transportation is built by American workers for everyday American families.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies like McDonald&rsquo;s (no. 6), which built domestic loyalty by meeting the <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6841754/food-the-burger-that-conquered-the-country/\" >lifestyle demands</a> of diners by offering fast, cheap and standardized dining experiences, have embodied the American identity so well that it&rsquo;s viewed abroad as a cultural embassy&mdash;an export of American reliability, consistency, <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6673339/food-fast-food-speeds-up-the-pace/\" >efficiency and accessibility</a>. It&rsquo;s not only a metaphor, but in fact, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2019/05/20/725139671/lost-in-austria-mcdonalds-can-help-with-a-hotline-to-the-u-s-embassy\"  target=\"_blank\">Austria in 2019</a> made it possible for Americans to call the U.S. consulate from any McDonald&rsquo;s location in the country. Over the decades, McDonald&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/01/28/travel/mcdonalds-international-locations-menu.html\"  target=\"_blank\">international locations</a> have evolved from outposts of American values to destinations in and of themselves, featuring specialty regional menus and architecture integrating local design quirks&mdash;recently documented in detail by photographer Gary He in the picture book <a href=\"https://mcatlas.com/pages/field-guide\"  target=\"_blank\"><em>McAtlas</em></a>. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re proud to be a brand that brings people together. While our roots are American, it&rsquo;s our local franchisees, suppliers, and crew members who make McDonald&rsquo;s a trusted neighbor in thousands of communities worldwide every day,&rdquo; says McDonald&rsquo;s Global Chief Impact Officer Jon Banner.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, McDonald&rsquo;s is not the only company to offer a slice of American culture to the world. The U.S. media and entertainment industry is the largest in the world, according to the <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/media-entertainment\"  target=\"_blank\">International Trade Administration</a>, and Disney (no. 11) is one of the biggest defining names in the business, combining art and technology to pioneer modern animation. The <a href=\"https://time.com/6323556/disney-100-history/\" >centenarian company</a>, renowned for exporting American storytelling, has transformed into a media and experiential giant, capturing and reflecting the country&rsquo;s traditions and ideals of optimism, ambition, and invention across the eras, and influencing popular culture globally. &#8220;For over a century, Disney has been woven into the American story, with beloved characters and timeless tales that have brought magic, joy and wonder to generations,&#8221; says Bob Iger, CEO of The Walt Disney Company. &#8220;Walt Disney&rsquo;s enduring vision for this great company remains our inspiration, shaping the creativity, curiosity and innovation that fuel our storytelling today. The dreams Walt envisioned for Disney continue to grow, taking us into the future and pushing the boundaries of what is possible for generations to come.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As times change and companies globalize, the challenge many legacy brands face is having to strike a balance between staying true to their American roots and adapting to the shifting needs of the market. Many American companies moved their manufacturing overseas in the late 1900s to save costs, although in the last 10 years, some companies have started to <a href=\"https://business.time.com/made-in-the-u-s-a/\" >bring production back stateside</a>, and tariffs imposed by the Trump administration are encouraging <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-manufacturing-domestic-tariffs/\"  target=\"_blank\">a wave of big companies</a> to reinvest in domestic manufacturing. John Deere (no. 55), one of the oldest companies on the list, has maintained a manufacturing stronghold in America&mdash;more than 75% of all products sold in the U.S. are assembled at domestic manufacturing facilities, where local farmers can come in and provide feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Since 1837 when we got our start, we&#8217;ve been defined by one mission: really supporting the people who provide all the food, fuel, fiber and infrastructure that we all rely on, and that&#8217;s farmers and contractors across America,&rdquo; says Mara Downing, Vice President of global brand management and corporate communications at John Deere. &ldquo;We&#8217;re really proud to have helped build America over the past two centuries, and we look forward to continuing to invest in our presence in America.&rdquo; In early 2025, John Deere announced that it would soon introduce <a href=\"https://time.com/collections/time-100-climate-2025/7326558/jennifer-preston/\" >an electric lineup</a> of agriculture tractors.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although what it means to be American is different today than it was two centuries ago, and globalization opens domestic brands to tough <a href=\"https://www.belfercenter.org/sites/default/files/pantheon_files/GreatTechRivalry_ChinavsUS_211207.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">foreign competition from China</a>, which has invested heavily in manufacturing infrastructure and talent development, the country&rsquo;s resilient entrepreneurial spirit fosters new generations of trailblazer companies like Apple (no. 2) and Google (no. 9), which have democratized once-complex technologies, while racing toward the next wave of digital breakthroughs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See the full list of America&rsquo;s most iconic companies below.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-datawrapper wp-block-embed-datawrapper\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" title=\"TIME America&#039;s Most Iconic Companies\" src=\"https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/P6OUY/1/#?secret=gCgBgQy5Kl\" data-secret=\"gCgBgQy5Kl\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"4436\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n",

If the U.S. could <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cdred61epg4o\"  target=\"_blank\">engineer</a> the extraction of a sitting authoritarian leader in Caracas, many reasoned, then Iran&rsquo;s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world-nation/story/2026-01-07/iran-on-edge-as-trump-threatens-action-following-venezuela-operation-amid-protests\"  target=\"_blank\">could suffer the same fate</a>. But that assumption is deeply flawed, if not dangerous, particularly for Iranians who hope for meaningful political change.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Despite President Donald Trump&rsquo;s repeated rhetoric about <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd9enjeey3go\"  target=\"_blank\">controlling</a> Venezuela and <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/trump-venezuelan-opposition-leader-respect-govern-after-maduro/story?id=128868550\"  target=\"_blank\">ending authoritarian rule there</a>, the reality is far more sobering. While Maduro was captured by U.S. forces and flown to New York to <a href=\"https://time.com/7343200/maduro-venezuela-charges-court-plea-cilia-flores/\" >face charges</a>, his longtime Vice President, <a href=\"https://time.com/7343035/delcy-rodriguez-venezuela-president/\" >Delcy Rodr&iacute;guez</a>, a regime loyalist, was sworn in as interim President. Her hold on power, backed by Venezuela&rsquo;s Supreme Court and much of the military, shows that the core institutions of the state have not collapsed and that the governing elite continues to exercise authority. Even opposition figures, such as the Nobel laureate Mar&iacute;a Corina Machado, have been <a href=\"https://time.com/7343295/venezuela-machado-trump-nobel-peace-prize/\" >excluded</a> from shaping what comes next, revealing the limits of a genuine political transformation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What has emerged for now is a system that survived by adapting, absorbing pressure, and recalibrating external relationships while preserving its internal foundations. This outcome suggests a central truth about Trump&rsquo;s approach that is not directed toward regime transformation or democratization, but rather the production of a more pliable and manageable governing structure that favors American interests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Iran, this distinction is critical. Those who assume that Trump would pursue the wholesale dismantling of the Islamic Republic misunderstand his record. The Maduro episode suggests that Washington&rsquo;s priority is leverage rather than liberation, and compliance rather than collapse. For the Iranian people, that is a bleak prospect, because a weakened but intact authoritarian state is often more violent and less accountable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The belief that the Maduro episode could be replicated in Iran also rests on a misleading comparison. Venezuela and Iran differ profoundly in their political structures, strategic environments, and modes of regime survival. The assumption that military action could fracture Iran&rsquo;s leadership without triggering wider consequences is particularly dangerous at a time when Iran is experiencing <a href=\"https://news.sky.com/story/inside-irans-protests-gunfire-hospital-raids-and-growing-anger-13491629\"  target=\"_blank\">sustained protests</a> across multiple towns and cities and internal strain that is not just economic but fundamentally political. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, the Maduro episode is likely to resonate deeply within Iran&rsquo;s own elite circles. For a leadership grappling with <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-08/iran-protests-explained-how-inflation-and-a-currency-crash-fueled-unrest\"  target=\"_blank\">economic exhaustion</a>, declining legitimacy, and looming<a href=\"https://monitoring.bbc.co.uk/product/b00047rx\"  target=\"_blank\"> succession questions</a>, Venezuela is a case study of endurance. The message is that regimes can survive extreme pressure if they maintain internal cohesion, suppress dissent decisively, and offer just enough flexibility to external actors to relieve pressure without conceding power. That lesson, if absorbed, could push Tehran toward greater repression at home even as it explores tactical accommodation abroad through negotiation with Trump. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Iranian society, this trajectory is deeply troubling. Large segments of the population are no longer merely demanding reform, but openly <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/protests-iran-sparked-economic-woes-now-nationwide-activists-129010386\"  target=\"_blank\">rejecting</a> the Islamic Republic itself. Yet external pressure in the absence of a clear internal political alternative does not empower them, it constrains them. This is why the current moment demands a difficult but necessary reckoning among Iranians themselves. Opposition movements have been effective at naming what they will no longer tolerate but have struggled to articulate a coherent alternative to replace it. Without a shared vision of political order, governance, and social compromise, protest risks being instrumentalized by both domestic elites and foreign powers, neither of which is invested in genuine democratic transformation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>History shows that external pressure has occasionally coincided with systemic collapse, as in the case of the Soviet Union. But more often it reshapes authoritarian regimes rather than topples them. A system that feels cornered can buy time by tightening control, insulating itself further from society, and taking greater risks beyond its borders. Trying to use the Venezuela playbook on Iran invites miscalculation and chips away at an already unstable regional balance, especially at a moment when <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/08/lebanon-iran-israel-us-nuclear-war-beirut/5cb1c308-ec7e-11f0-91a9-9928b22be817_story.html\"  target=\"_blank\">tensions</a> with Israel are once again<strong> </strong>approaching dangerous thresholds. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The central lesson of the Maduro episode should be one of caution. External coercion absent a credible internal political project does not deliver freedom. For Western policymakers, mistaking pressure for transformation risks leaving the Islamic Republic bruised but standing. For Iranians, expecting salvation from abroad risks delaying the harder work of defining what kind of political future they want, rather than simply what they wish to escape.</p>\n",

TRAUMA TWO\"/>\n\n\n\n<p>The stars and stripes are flying as Dr. Michael Robinavitch motorcycles to work in the opening sequence of <a href=\"https://time.com/7274583/the-pitt-finale-review/\" ><em>The Pitt</em></a>&rsquo;s excellent second season. It&rsquo;s 7 a.m. on the Fourth of July, a holiday that will flood the Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center with heatstroke cases, injured swimmers, and kids messing around with fireworks. Before that chaos takes hold, it&rsquo;s worth noticing the American flags that flank the entrance to the emergency department. In choosing this day to revisit the Pitt&rsquo;s tireless ER staff, one of the most deservedly acclaimed shows that premiered last year doesn&rsquo;t just wring gross-out humor from a hot dog-eating-contest winner&rsquo;s digestive distress (though it&rsquo;s not too self-serious to resist doing that). It also reclaims the increasingly fraught concept of patriotism as a practice of caring for our neighbors, whoever they may be.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Ten months have passed since the events of Season 1, when a mass shooting at a local music festival pushed the already overworked, under-rested team past their limits. This is a transitional day in the ER. Robby&mdash;<em>The Pitt </em>executive producer, writer, director, and star <a href=\"https://time.com/7316905/noah-wyle-wins-emmy-the-pitt/\" >Noah Wyle</a>&rsquo;s instantly iconic attending physician&mdash;is leading his final shift before a three-month leave that sounds like an awfully good idea following his meltdown last season. &ldquo;I give him one,&rdquo; predicts veteran nurse Dana Evans (Katherine LaNasa), who&rsquo;s back on the job despite declaring herself done after being assaulted by a patient; it takes a workaholic to know one. Covering for Robby while he&rsquo;s away will be Dr. Baran Al-Hashimi (Sepideh Moafi), a technology enthusiast and trauma center newbie who&rsquo;s already making big changes, and whose untested idealism clashes with his jaded pragmatism. In the wake of <a href=\"https://www.thecut.com/article/tracy-ifeachor-the-pitt-church-jesus-house-rumors.html\"  target=\"_blank\">Tracy Ifeachor&rsquo;s much-speculated-about departure</a> from the show, there are also signs that the writers are setting her up to be his new love interest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happily, there hasn&rsquo;t been much other attrition at the Pitt. <a href=\"https://time.com/7275814/the-pitt-mel-neurodivergence-autism-adhd/\" >Dr. Mel King</a> (Taylor Dearden) is still treating patients with openhearted thoroughness, though she&rsquo;s anxious about the deposition she&rsquo;ll have to give, in the afternoon, after being named in her first malpractice case. Dr. Trinity Santos (Isa Briones), still brash but now an overloaded second-year resident, reminds Mel that such lawsuits are a standard occupational hazard, and that the hospital protects her from liability. With her 21st birthday looming, the prodigy Victoria Javadi (Shabana Azeez) continues to resist her star-surgeon mom&rsquo;s (Deepti Gupta) pressure to train in surgery. Just returning to the ER, a rehabbed and humbled Dr. Frank Langdon (Patrick Ball) is desperate to earn Robby&rsquo;s forgiveness for the nearly career-ending transgression of taking a patient&rsquo;s meds. But his former mentor isn&rsquo;t ready to absolve him, banishing Langdon to triage in a transparent act of avoidance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/katherine-lanasa.jpg\" alt=\"Sc 21 - INT. CENTRAL WORK AREA\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In some ways, <em>The Pitt</em>&rsquo;s breakout first season put it at a disadvantage going into the second.<em> </em>The real-time format is no longer a novelty. Characters whose relationships and backstories and defining personal conflicts were revealed slowly as they went about the workday are no longer so mysterious. Viewers will also go in, this time, aware that a 15-episode season must mean an extra-long shift for at least some of the main cast, so one or more major crises seem inevitable. With only nine episodes sent to critics, I couldn&rsquo;t spoil creator and showrunner R. Scott Gemmill&rsquo;s endgame for the season if I wanted to. But so far, one small twist that ups the pressure on Robby and his team aside, Gemmill shows little interest in the kind of hysterical stake-raising that could easily turn a hospital drama absurd (see: <a href=\"https://time.com/6914179/how-greys-anatomy-characters-died-or-left/\" ><em>Grey&rsquo;s Anatomy</em></a>).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead, we get the subtler pleasures of observing how characters evolve and connect. From our first glimpse of Dennis Whitaker, a.k.a. Huckleberry (Gerran Howell)&mdash;now a full-fledged resident despite an extremely typical-for-Whitaker delay in receiving his updated badge&mdash;it&rsquo;s clear the timid student doctor we met in Season 1 has found his footing in the ER. There&rsquo;s a heartening exchange in which Dr. Cassie McKay (Fiona Dourif), a recovering addict who got a late start in the medical field, offers her support to Langdon as he works his 12-step program. Gemmill finds fresh uses for the real-time structure, too. As common as sexual assault storylines are in procedurals of all kinds, I had never, before this season, encountered one that did justice to the sheer amount of time, care, and gentleness it takes to assemble a rape kit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/patrick-ball.jpg\" alt=\"SC.17 INT. CHAIRS\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Few shows that become phenomena the way <em>The Pitt </em>did in its first outing escape a sophomore backlash, and it&rsquo;s easy to anticipate what the criticisms will be in this case. Isn&rsquo;t a drama where public-health heroes smack down the scourges of poverty, discrimination, violence, anti-science lunacy, and, in the new season, AI&rsquo;s encroachment into workplaces that thrive on human expertise just impotent, virtue-signaling, liberal competency porn? Doesn&rsquo;t it all reek of sanctimony and self-congratulation? Occasionally it does. A scene where Robby looks on like a proud papa as Whitaker leads the latest student cohort in the staff&rsquo;s customary moment of silence following a patient&rsquo;s death, for instance, tugs a bit too deliberately on the heartstrings.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the time, though, even if it&rsquo;s largely preaching to the progressive-pilled, <em>The Pitt </em>feels more like an inoculation against the normalization of cruelty than an unearned distraction from it. This is, in part, a function of how many different and surprising storylines Gemmill juggles&mdash;how frequently we see well-intentioned assumptions proven wrong, how little time the heroes get to celebrate triumphs, how often they fail as a result of exhaustion or systemic obstacles too entrenched to overcome or just dumb luck. <em>The Pitt </em>is not a fantasy of success in the face of impossible odds. It&rsquo;s a vision of how much better things could be if more of us committed to showing up for our community, to reaching out rather than closing off, to <em>trying</em> instead of shutting down.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/shabana-azeez-isa-briones-gerran-howell-noah-wyle.jpg\" alt=\"INT. AMBULANCE BAY SC. 4\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This&mdash;not nationalism or jingoism or American-flag lapel pins&mdash;is the form of patriotism the show is championing. You see it most vividly through the patients who prove most memorable. A filthy man whose stench sets off a rebellion in the waiting room sees his dignity restored under Dana&rsquo;s gruff but nonjudgmental care. (Fresh off an Emmy win, LaNasa has essentially been promoted to second lead, and she makes the most of it.) A baby abandoned in the restroom gets the same scrupulous attention one with well-insured parents would enjoy. When a callous new student doctor, James Ogilvie (Lucas Iverson), can&rsquo;t restrain himself from cracking jokes at the expense of a suffering man whose weight exceeds the limits of the ER&rsquo;s equipment, he&rsquo;s the one who comes off as an embarrassment, not the patient. By showing us professionals who honor the humanity of people who are too often dehumanized on screen and in the world, <em>The Pitt</em> isn&rsquo;t just lionizing its central characters; it&rsquo;s also laying the groundwork for conversations that give dimension to lives that have more in common with viewers&rsquo; own than we might like to admit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, sure, it&rsquo;s all very <a href=\"https://poets.org/poem/new-colossus\"  target=\"_blank\">Emma Lazarus</a> coded. Give the Pitt your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning&mdash;sometimes literally&mdash;to breathe free. But that poem is no smug clich&eacute;. Its place in our national mythology has been <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/trump-official-says-statue-of-liberty-poem-is-about-europeans\"  target=\"_blank\">under attack</a> for a while now. Last year, a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/france-trump-statue-of-liberty-glucksmann-248cbd501c7b66d7b37988bf6abdacf8\"  target=\"_blank\">French politician demanded</a> that the U.S. return Lady Liberty to France. If she drops her torch,<em> The Pitt </em>suggests, it&rsquo;s on all of us to pick it up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n",

There were 23 such events in 2025, causing 276 fatalities and a total of $115 billion in damages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;2025 is another very active year that we&#8217;ve seen in a series of years, dating back about a decade,&rdquo; says Adam Smith, senior climate impact scientist at Climate Central and former lead scientist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&rsquo;s (NOAA) U.S. Billion-Dollar Weather and Climate Disasters program.&nbsp;</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://time.com/7335166/la-wildfire-recovery-climate-warning/\" >wildfires that swept through Los Angeles</a> last January had the highest toll of the year&mdash;and were the costliest wildfires on record. With over $61 billion in losses, the fires were twice as damaging as the previous record&mdash;the 2018 wildfire season. &ldquo;That continues a trend of these costly, mega disaster fires that we unfortunately have seen out west in recent years,&rdquo; says Smith.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Severe weather&mdash;from a derecho that hit the Northeast in April to a string of tornado outbreaks in the spring and summer&mdash;made up 91% of the billion-dollar disasters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The total cost of all these severe storm events, as a subset of the entire year, was about $51 billion which is one of the highest on record for that hazard type,&rdquo; says Smith.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was one silver lining: 2025 marked a quiet year for hurricanes in the United States, with no major hurricane making landfall&mdash;despite an active season over the Atlantic ocean.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>Read More: </em></strong><a href=\"https://time.com/7325531/2025-quiet-hurricane-year/\" ><em>Is 2025 a &ldquo;Quiet&rdquo; Hurricane Year?</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;&#8203;&#8203;Three Category Five hurricanes formed over the Atlantic, which is only the second time that&#8217;s happened on record,&rdquo; says Smith. &ldquo;We were just lucky that meteorological conditions helped steer away those very powerful storms from making landfall, otherwise it would have been an even costlier year.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>NOAA began tracking billion-dollar disasters in 1980. Since then the U.S. has sustained 426 billion-dollar disasters, with a total cost exceeding $3.1 trillion. But they are occurring with increasing frequency&mdash;2023 and 2024 broke previous records with 28 and 27 billion-dollar disasters, respectively, with 2025 ranking third with 23 events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The average length of time between billion-dollar disasters has fallen as well&mdash;from 82 days during the 1980s to 16 days during the last 10 years. In 2025, the U.S. experienced a billion-dollar weather or climate disaster once every 10 days.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Climate change is increasing the frequency and severity of some types of extreme [weather] events, leading to more damages, and that, combined with growing our built environment in harm&#8217;s way, is what amplifies the total damage in terms of the frequency and cost of these impacts,&rdquo; says Smith.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last May, NOAA decommissioned its billion-dollar disaster tracking, citing &#8220;evolving priorities, statutory mandates, and staffing changes.&#8221; The change came amid major cuts to the federal workforce, as over 2,200 NOAA employees were let go. Climate Central took over and relaunched the database in October.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The work is essential, says Smith, who chose to leave NOAA last year after 20-year career&mdash;especially as we look to adapt to increasing climate risks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;2025, is the 15th year in a row that there&#8217;s been an above average number of these billion dollar disasters. So we&#8217;re on this elevated long-term trend, and within that last 15 years, the last 10 have really been on another level as far as the frequency and intensity of these impacts in all parts of the nation,&rdquo; says Smith. &ldquo;So this information is increasingly important, as we plan for and try to live in the future.&rdquo;</p>\n",

Kennedy Jr. said the updated guidelines&mdash;which include a new, inverted food pyramid that prioritizes the consumption of protein, dairy, healthy fats, vegetables, and fruits&mdash;highlight the importance of eating &ldquo;real&rdquo; food. &ldquo;Nothing matters more for health outcomes, economic productivity, military readiness,&rdquo; Kennedy said at a White House press briefing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div class=\"time-embed time-embed__twitter\" data-provider=\"twitter\" data-url=\"https://twitter.com/SecKennedy/status/2008951347878506772\" ><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">EAT REAL FOOD. <a href=\"https://t.co/529KCib9LF\"  target=\"_blank\">https://t.co/529KCib9LF</a></p>&mdash; Secretary Kennedy (@SecKennedy) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SecKennedy/status/2008951347878506772?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\"  target=\"_blank\">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The guidelines reflect many of Kennedy&rsquo;s own positions on nutrition and the priorities of his Make America Healthy Again movement. They advise people to significantly limit highly processed foods, which Kennedy has repeatedly blamed as a source of what he refers to as <a href=\"https://time.com/7321128/republican-maha-movement-plan-democrats/\" >America&rsquo;s chronic-disease epidemic.</a> The term &ldquo;highly processed foods&rdquo; is not clearly defined in the guidelines, but are described as foods &ldquo;laden with refined carbohydrates, added sugars, excess sodium, unhealthy fats, and chemical additives.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The guidelines also encourage the consumption of greater amounts of protein&mdash;including from animal sources such as red meat, poultry, and eggs&mdash;than what previous guidelines advised, and recommend that people eat full-fat dairy and cook with butter and beef tallow. These foods contain saturated fats, which earlier dietary guidelines had urged people to avoid. Research on the health hazards of saturated fats has been mixed, but has largely shown that consuming too much of them can <a href=\"https://www.cspi.org/article/saturated-fat-good-or-bad\"  target=\"_blank\">increase cardiovascular risks</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Kennedy and others in the Trump Administration have contended that saturated fats have been unfairly vilified and are actually essential to a healthy diet. &ldquo;We are ending the war on saturated fats,&rdquo; Kennedy said Wednesday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, while Kennedy and other Trump officials had previously hinted that they were seeking to loosen restrictions on saturated fats, the revamped dietary guidance maintained the longstanding recommendation of limiting consumption of such fats to 10% of daily calories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marion Nestle, a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies, and public health at New York University, said this advice was contradictory. &ldquo;If you increase the amount of protein, meat, and full-fat dairy in your diet, you will not be able to keep your saturated fat intake below 10% of calories, and will have a harder time maintaining calorie balance,&rdquo; since fat has twice the calories of proteins or carbohydrates, Nestle said in an email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The American Heart Association, which recommends that people limit consumption of saturated fats to <a href=\"https://www.heart.org/en/healthy-living/healthy-eating/eat-smart/fats/saturated-fats\"  target=\"_blank\">6% of daily calories</a>, said it was concerned about some of the protein-related recommendations in the updated guidelines.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Protein is an essential component of a healthy diet, and we urge more scientific research on both the appropriate amount of protein consumption and the best protein sources for optimal health,&rdquo; the group said in a <a href=\"https://newsroom.heart.org/news/releases-20260107-6915862\"  target=\"_blank\">statement</a>. &ldquo;Pending that research, we encourage consumers to prioritize plant-based proteins, seafood and lean meats and to limit high-fat animal products including red meat, butter, lard and tallow, which are linked to increased cardiovascular risk.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some doctors and nutritionists said they generally approved of the advice to eat less sugar and fewer highly processed foods. &ldquo;That is the one great strength of these recommendations,&rdquo; Nestle said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Bobby Mukkamala, president of the American Medical Association, said in a <a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/ama-press-releases/ama-applauds-dietary-guidelines-announces-commitments-nutrition\"  target=\"_blank\">statement</a> that the group applauded the updated guidelines &ldquo;for spotlighting the highly processed foods, sugar-sweetened beverages, and excess sodium that fuel heart disease, diabetes, obesity, and other chronic illnesses.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some, however, cautioned against rejecting all processed foods. Dr. Neal Barnard, president of the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, said that some foods that are considered processed can be healthy, such as breakfast cereals and breads that are fortified with vitamins and other nutrients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Guidelines err in promoting meat and dairy products, which are principal drivers of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity,&rdquo; Barnard said in a <a href=\"https://www.pcrm.org/news/news-releases/dietary-guidelines-are-mixed-bag-show-industry-influence-says-physicians-group\"  target=\"_blank\">statement</a>. &ldquo;The Guidelines take a sledgehammer approach to processed foods, but plant-based and vitamin-fortified processed foods actually reduce the risk of birth defects, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some health experts said they also worried about the Trump Administration&rsquo;s decision to ditch specific alcohol consumption limits. Previous dietary guidelines had advised men to restrict alcohol consumption to two beverages a day, and women were urged to have no more than one drink per day. The updated guidance says only that people should &ldquo;consume less alcohol for better overall health&rdquo; and that certain people, including pregnant women and people who are recovering from alcohol use disorder, should avoid alcohol completely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Alcohol is a social lubricant that brings people together,&rdquo; said Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, when asked to clarify the change at the White House press briefing. &ldquo;In the best-case scenario, I don&rsquo;t think you should drink alcohol, but it does allow people an excuse to bond and socialize, and there&rsquo;s probably nothing healthier than having a good time with friends in a safe way.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The World Health Organization <a href=\"https://www.who.int/europe/news/item/04-01-2023-no-level-of-alcohol-consumption-is-safe-for-our-health\"  target=\"_blank\">said in 2023</a> that no amount of alcohol is safe for health. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that drinking alcohol increases a person&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/risk-factors/alcohol.html#cdc_risk_factors_other_factor-health-advice-for-people-who-drink-alcohol-or-are-thinking-of-drinking-alcohol\"  target=\"_blank\">risk of developing several kinds of cancer</a>, including mouth, colon, and breast cancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Dietary Guidelines for Americans is updated every five years and will next be revised in 2030. The guidelines set standards for many government-funded food assistance and meal programs, including the National School Lunch Program and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).</p>\n",

The poll also found that 72% of respondents feared that the U.S. would become overly involved in Venezuela as a result of the attack.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>But poll respondents were split along party lines. About 65% of Republicans approved of the military intervention, whereas only 11% of Democrats and 23% of independents did.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other polls showed a similar partisan divide. About 66% of Republican respondents in <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/53813-americans-are-divided-on-us-military-action-in-venezuela\"  target=\"_blank\">YouGov surveys</a> completed in the 48 hours after Maduro was captured said they strongly or somewhat supported the U.S. using military force to capture Maduro, compared to just 14% of Democrats and 27% of independents. Overall, about 36% of adults approved of the operation and 39% opposed it, the surveys found. About 25% said they were unsure how they felt about the strike.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Americans were split over whether the operation would improve the situation in the South American country: 34% said yes, while 35% said it would worsen the political climate there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Saturday attack came after <a href=\"https://time.com/7340252/venezuela-oil-tanker-trump-machado-maduro/\" >months of pressure</a> by the Trump Administration against Maduro&rsquo;s government over allegations of drug trafficking. The U.S. operation&mdash;the largest of its kind in Latin America since the 1989 invasion of Panama&mdash;stunned lawmakers and the public. The Trump Administration has heralded the military action as a victory, but it has drawn <a href=\"https://time.com/7343348/trump-venezuela-maduro-un-security-council-meeting/\" >outcry</a> from global leaders. A spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights office <a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2026/01/1166707\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> on Tuesday that the operation has made &ldquo;all States less safe around the world.&rdquo; Several Democratic lawmakers have <a href=\"https://time.com/7343574/trump-impeachment-calls-gather-pace-venezuela-fallout/\" >called</a> for President Donald Trump&rsquo;s impeachment in the aftermath of the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://time.com/7342937/venezuela-trump-maduro-oil/?itm_source=parsely-api\" >assertion</a> following the operation that the U.S. would &ldquo;run the country&rdquo; until a &ldquo;proper and judicious transition&rdquo; of power takes place also sparked controversy, as did his decision to name <a href=\"https://time.com/7343035/delcy-rodriguez-venezuela-president/\" >Delcy Rodr&iacute;guez</a>, who served as Venezuela&rsquo;s vice president under Maduro beginning in 2018, as the most likely candidate to take over governing the country, while distancing himself from Venezuelan opposition leader <a href=\"https://time.com/7343295/venezuela-machado-trump-nobel-peace-prize/\" >Mar&iacute;a Corina Machado</a>.

Results again differed based on political affiliation: 74% of Republicans approved, compared to 13% of Democrats and 34% of independents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the majority of Americans&mdash;63%&mdash;said that the attack should have required congressional approval, according to the <em>Post</em>&rsquo;s poll. Those reactions were again split along party lines, with only 24% of Republicans saying that the Trump Administration should have gotten congressional approval to embark on the operation, compared to 94% of Democrats and 70% of independents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democratic lawmakers have <a href=\"https://time.com/7343574/trump-impeachment-calls-gather-pace-venezuela-fallout/\" >condemned</a> Trump for not getting authorization from Congress to launch the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I cannot stand by as my Republican colleagues allow President Trump to defy the rule of law, repeatedly overstep the authority of Congress and undermine our national security and the well-being of my fellow Americans,&rdquo; Rep. April McClain Delaney of Maryland <a href=\"https://mcclaindelaney.house.gov/media/press-releases/congresswoman-mcclain-delaney-statement-trumps-illegal-actions-venezuela\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> in a statement on Monday. &ldquo;Over the weekend, we saw the President&mdash;without authorization or approval from Congress, as required by our Constitution&mdash;launch an attack on Venezuela and voice his intention to &lsquo;run&rsquo; the country.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>Post</em> also found that about half of Americans felt that the U.S. should try Maduro for drug trafficking charges. Maduro <a href=\"https://time.com/7343200/maduro-venezuela-charges-court-plea-cilia-flores/\" >pleaded</a> not guilty to charges including narco-terrorism and conspiracy to import cocaine on Monday.

We do not want you here,&rdquo; the city&rsquo;s mayor, Jacob Frey, said at a Wednesday afternoon press conference with other city officials. &ldquo;Your stated reason for being in this city is to create some kind of safety, and you are doing exactly the opposite. People are being hurt. Families are being ripped apart &hellip; and now somebody is dead.&rdquo;</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>The woman was shot while in her vehicle amid the ongoing immigration crackdown in Minneapolis. Video shared on social media shows agents approaching a car and one attempting to open the driver&rsquo;s side door. The car then briefly reverses before beginning to drive away, and another officer appears to draw his firearm and fire multiple shots toward it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Officials have not yet publicly identified the woman. Police said she appears to be white and a U.S. citizen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/DHSgov/status/2008958123092979817?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\"  target=\"_blank\">statement</a> that the ICE agents were acting in self-defense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Today, ICE officers in Minneapolis were conducting targeted operations when rioters began blocking ICE officers and one of these violent rioters weaponized her vehicle, attempting to run over our law enforcement officers in an attempt to kill them&mdash;an act of domestic terrorism,&rdquo; DHS spokeswoman Tricia McLaughlin said. &ldquo;An ICE officer, fearing for his life, the lives of his fellow law enforcement and the safety of the public, fired defensive shots.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local and state officials, however, have rejected that explanation. Frey, noting he had seen video of the incident, said that the assertion that the shooting was an act of self-defense is &ldquo;bullsh-t&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I myself saw a video of the shots being fired as the car was driving away,&rdquo; Frey said at the press conference. When asked again by media whether the driver was driving towards an ICE officer on foot, Frey said it did not appear to be the case. &ldquo;What I can tell you is the narrative that this was just done in self-defense is a garbage narrative that is not true. It has no truth, and it needs to be stated very clearly.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. Amy Klobuchar similarly pushed back against DHS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen the video. Don&rsquo;t believe this propaganda machine,&rdquo; the governor <a href=\"https://x.com/GovTimWalz/status/2008980259199394021\"  target=\"_blank\">wrote</a> on X, responding to a post about the shooting from the department. &ldquo;The state will ensure there is a full, fair, and expeditious investigation to ensure accountability and justice.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We need full transparency and an investigation of what happened, and I am deeply concerned that statements made by DHS do not appear to reflect video evidence and on-the-ground accounts,&#8221; Klobuchar said in a <a href=\"https://x.com/amyklobuchar/status/2009002354998182209?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\"  target=\"_blank\">social media post</a>. &#8220;While our immigration enforcement should be focused on apprehending and prosecuting violent criminals to make our communities safer, these ICE actions are doing the opposite and making our state less safe.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minneapolis City Council member Jason Chavez told <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/ice-related-shooting-occurred-minnesota-governor/story?id=128984401\"  target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a> that the victim &ldquo;was an observer&rdquo; and was &ldquo;watching out for our immigrant neighbors.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Donald Trump, meanwhile, claimed in a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855701696773990\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post on Truth Social</a>, without evidence, that the woman who was shot was &ldquo;a professional agitator.&#8221; Although video seems to show the car driving past the ICE agent who fired shots at the vehicle and the agent walking away, Trump said that &#8220;it is hard to believe he is alive.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The situation is being studied, in its entirety, but the reason these incidents are happening is because the Radical Left is threatening, assaulting, and targeting our Law Enforcement Officers and ICE Agents on a daily basis,&#8221; the President said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other Republican lawmakers also spoke in defense of ICE following the shooting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;ICE agents are enforcing America&rsquo;s laws and delivering exactly what Kentuckians voted for: a secure border and the deportation of dangerous illegal criminals,&#8221; Kentucky Rep. Andy Barr <a href=\"https://x.com/RepAndyBarr/status/2009005918177120345\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">wrote on X</a>, &#8220;Targeting ICE agents will never end well for anyone who tries.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tennessee Rep. Andy Ogles accused both Frey and his home-state Nashville Mayor Freddie O&#8217;Connell, both Democrats, of putting ICE officers in &#8220;danger.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&rsquo;s deeper than rhetoric, its political decisions intended to betray ICE and Federal partners,&#8221; Ogles <a href=\"https://x.com/RepOgles/status/2008995945804124359?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;ICE agents are in danger because of them. Illegal aliens are NOT our friends.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O&rsquo;Hara, also present at the press conference with local officials on Wednesday, said that the woman in the car was blocking ICE vehicles. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;At some point, a federal law enforcement officer approached her on foot, and the vehicle began to drive off,&rdquo; O&rsquo;Hara said. Two shots were fired, and the vehicle then veered and crashed into the side of the roadway. The woman, who suffered a gunshot wound to the head, was rushed to the hospital, where she was pronounced dead, according to the chief.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frey has been vocal in arguing that ICE officers in the city have sowed &ldquo;chaos&rdquo; rather than order. Democratic Sen. Tina Smith joined him in saying that federal immigration agents should leave Minneapolis <a href=\"https://x.com/SenTinaSmith/status/2008952568442143222\"  target=\"_blank\">in a social media post</a> following the shooting, writing that ICE should depart &ldquo;now for everyone&rsquo;s safety.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a press conference in the afternoon, Gov. Walz said that the state did not need &#8220;any further help from the federal government.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To Donald Trump and Kristi Noem: you&#8217;ve done enough,&#8221; he continued, calling the events &#8220;totally predictable&#8221; and &#8220;totally avoidable.&#8221; He said he understands that Minnesotans will want to protest, which he called a &#8220;patriotic duty,&#8221; but called for them to do so peacefully. &#8220;It needs to be done safely,&#8221; he said. Protestors have already begun <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-ysFQeHuDk\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">organizing</a> in Minneapolis.</p>\n",

Hundreds more have been detained as authorities move to suppress demonstrations that show little sign of fading.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>The protests have spread to more than 200 locations across 26 of Iran&rsquo;s 31 provinces since last week, the Human Rights Activists News Agency (HRANA) reported on Monday. HRANA has also documented more than 2,000 arrests so far, underscoring the scale of the state&rsquo;s response. Iranian officials have not released their own comprehensive casualty or arrest figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-snapback-sanctions-nuclear-us-israel-war-5b13ed1781659c1a9871427881ef239b\"  target=\"_blank\">Sanctions</a> tied to Iran&rsquo;s nuclear program&mdash;combined with the lingering economic damage of a <a href=\"https://time.com/7316478/iran-israel-war-nuclear-program-us/\" >12-day war</a> last summer with Israel and the United States, during which <a href=\"https://time.com/7296469/u-s-strikes-iran-nuclear-trump-war/\" >U.S. forces struck</a> key Iranian nuclear sites&mdash;have battered the country&rsquo;s economy. The rial has collapsed to roughly 1.4 million to the dollar, fueling inflation that has pushed basic goods out of reach for many Iranians. Long-standing corruption and mismanagement have only deepened the crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://time.com/7343093/trump-venezuela-us-next-colombia-cuba-greenland-iran-mexico/\" >said last week</a> that if Iran &ldquo;violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue,&rdquo; adding: &ldquo;We are locked and loaded and ready to go.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iranian officials have responded with increasingly blunt warnings. On Wednesday, Iran&rsquo;s judiciary chief, Gholamhossein Mohseni Ejei, said there would be &ldquo;no leniency&rdquo; for anyone he accused of aiding Iran&rsquo;s enemies, explicitly framing the protests as part of a foreign-backed campaign. He accused Israel and the United States of using &ldquo;hybrid methods&rdquo; to destabilize the country, according to state media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Islamic Republic considers the intensification of such rhetoric against the Iranian nation as a threat and will not leave its continuation without a response,&rdquo; said Maj. Gen. Amir Hatami, Iran&rsquo;s army chief, in remarks widely interpreted as a warning to Washington.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei reinforced that message over the weekend, declaring that &ldquo;rioters must be put in their place&rdquo;&mdash;language that <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/02/iranian-officials-warn-trump-not-cross-red-line-threats-intervene-protests\"  target=\"_blank\">analysts</a> say effectively gives security forces license to escalate repression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The economic situation in Iran has been bad and has continued to get worse,&rdquo; says Naysan Rafati, senior Iran analyst for the International Crisis Group. The protests, he adds, reflect a &ldquo;general, very deep malaise&rdquo; that cuts across class and geography.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The scope of protests across Iran </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The current wave of demonstrations began in Tehran&rsquo;s Grand Bazaar, where shopkeepers protested the rial&rsquo;s free fall. But what started as economic anger has quickly taken on broader political meaning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Whatever the initial spark might be&mdash;so in this case, economic&mdash;the tinder of discontent is much bigger than that,&rdquo; Rafati tells TIME. &ldquo;So you very quickly get specific triggers for protest that lead to wider anti-regime, anti-system sentiment.&rdquo; The scale, he argues, &ldquo;is significant,&rdquo; even if the numbers fluctuate day to day.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Footage circulating on social media has <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-economic-protests-129cea0f8c39b6d5b5603c634acaa61e\"  target=\"_blank\">shown protests</a> from Tehran to provincial cities and university campuses. In the capital, a sit-in at the Grand Bazaar earlier this week prompted security forces to deploy tear gas and temporarily shut the market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Western provinces&mdash;including Ilam, Kermanshah, Lorestan, and Hamedan&mdash;have seen the deadliest clashes so far, according to Kurdish-Iranian rights group Hengaw, which says those regions account for a majority of fatalities. Iranian state-aligned outlets have reported vandalism and confrontations following funerals for slain protesters, a familiar flashpoint in past uprisings.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Iranian government&rsquo;s response</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Iranian officials have attempted a mix of limited economic relief and force. The government <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-war-nuclear-dca88a657009aae21e2b8b5086c682ce\"  target=\"_blank\">recently announced </a>a small monthly subsidy&mdash;about $7 per household&mdash;for food staples, a move that will reach more than 70 million people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mohammad Ja&rsquo;far Ghaempanah, the president&rsquo;s deputy for executive affairs, described the situation as a &ldquo;full-fledged economic war&rdquo; and called for what he termed &ldquo;economic surgery.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But history suggests such measures are unlikely to calm unrest on their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The system has so far stuck to what&#8217;s been its typical playbook,&rdquo; Rafati says: modest concessions alongside overwhelming repression. &ldquo;The government was able to quell all of those protests, but it was never able to really address the underlying grievances. Those grievances compound.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Vatanka, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, argues that the impact of sanctions and the limited ability to trade has effectively turned Iran into a &ldquo;one customer country&rdquo; where China gets the vast majority of its oil. &ldquo;You&#8217;ve had a combination of a number of factors that have come together and created this explosive cocktail,&rdquo; he says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Foreign investors have steered clear of Iranian markets, while Iranians themselves have taken money out of the country&rsquo;s banks and purchased property elsewhere, creating a liquidity issue. Vatanka, who was born in Tehran, also attributes the economic conditions and failed Iranian response to the mismanagement of the theocracy, which he says &ldquo;puts ideology and certain foreign policy priorities ahead of economic development.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong><strong>The role of the United States</strong></strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s renewed warnings have added a volatile international dimension to the unrest. His comments came just days after U.S. forces <a href=\"https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/\" >captured</a> Venezuela&rsquo;s deposed president, Nicolas Maduro, following a months-long pressure campaign&mdash;an episode closely watched in Tehran.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Operation Midnight Hammer, the U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear facilities last June, and Washington&rsquo;s recent actions in Venezuela have given Trump&rsquo;s threats new credibility, analysts say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If your go-to tool for quelling these protests is repression, and now you have the prospect of a potential U.S. intervention&hellip;then you&#8217;re dealing with both dissent from below, but also the possibility of action from abroad,&rdquo; Rafati says.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whether Iran&rsquo;s leadership can weather the current unrest remains uncertain. What is clear is that the protests have exposed deep fractures&mdash;and that the response from both Tehran and Washington could shape Iran&rsquo;s trajectory for years to come.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The Trump administration really is going after a regime change without calling it out,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;And it&#8217;s playing a patient game, and is using all sorts of tools, including maximum pressure, which is mostly about economic sanctions, but occasionally it uses kinetic action.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

Trump has heralded his <a href=\"https://time.com/7305626/chaotic-world-of-trumps-tariffs/\" >global tariffs</a> as the reason behind this notion, claiming that the money raised from the controversial levies can go back to the American people, specifically those from &ldquo;middle and lower-income&rdquo; households.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>In a defiant post defending his tariffs against ongoing criticism and legal challenges, Trump in November insisted that people who are against his tariffs are &ldquo;fools&rdquo; and that many Americans will soon reap the benefits of the charges.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are now the richest, most respected country in the world. We are taking in trillions of dollars and will soon begin paying down our enormous debt&hellip; Record investment in the USA, plants and factories going up all over the place,&rdquo; <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115519726463094783\"  target=\"_blank\">claimed</a> Trump via Truth Social. &ldquo;A dividend of at least $2000 a person (not including high-income people) will be paid to everyone.&rdquo; The President did not specify who would qualify as &ldquo;high-income&rdquo; by his estimation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump doubled down on the idea that Americans will soon see some financial returns during his Christmas address at the White House, boasting that 2026 is set to be &ldquo;the largest tax refund season of all time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what is the status of the dividend and is there a detailed plan in place to help make the payments a reality? Here&rsquo;s what to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The status of the proposed </strong><strong>$2,000 payments</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, a White House official told TIME that, in light of the revenue raised by tariffs, the Administration remains &ldquo;committed to putting this windfall to good use for the American people and continues to explore all options.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The update echoes scant statements made by White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt in November. When briefing the media on the status of the dividend, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0E_a2r7iQ1E\"  target=\"_blank\">Leavitt said</a> that although there is no timeline in place, &ldquo;the President made it clear he wants to make it happen, so his team of economic advisors are looking into it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Adding to the vagueness behind the dividend proposal, <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-11-09-25-treasury-secretary-scott/story?id=127340500\"  target=\"_blank\">Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent</a> in an interview last year said the payment could come &ldquo;in lots of forms.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It could be just the tax decreases that we are seeing on the President&#8217;s agenda. No tax on tips, no tax on overtime, no tax on Social Security, deductibility of auto loans,&rdquo; Bessent told ABC News in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, in late December, when asked if Americans should expect to receive the $2,000 check in 2026, White House National Economic Council director <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/kevin-hassett-white-house-national-economic-council-director-face-the-nation-transcript-12-21-2025/\"  target=\"_blank\">Kevin Hassett said</a> it all depends on &ldquo;what happens with Congress.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Congress is going to have to send that money to those people,&rdquo; he told CBS. &ldquo;I would expect that in the new year, the President will bring forth a proposal to Congress to make that happen.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of early January, a plan of action has yet to be unveiled to the public.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Experts raise concerns about potential challenges </strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If the payment were to be made to Americans from low and middle-income households, this could include over 80% of the total U.S. population (over <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/popclock/\"  target=\"_blank\">274 million people</a>), per a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/race-and-ethnicity/2024/05/31/the-state-of-the-american-middle-class/\"  target=\"_blank\">Pew Research</a> study from 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial experts have repeatedly raised logistical concerns regarding the enormity of the payment and how it would be enacted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it&#8217;s a very realistic possibility, as legislators would have a pretty large concern over its cost,&rdquo; Ryan Cummings, chief of staff at Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research, tells TIME, arguing that the President can&rsquo;t &ldquo;unilaterally decide [he&rsquo;s] going to give away <a href=\"https://www.crfb.org/blogs/tariff-dividends-could-cost-600-billion-year\"  target=\"_blank\">hundreds of billions</a>.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Taxing is one component, and the spending is another component, separated by legislation. You can&rsquo;t just tax people, and then use <em>that</em> to give out to other people again, not without legislative ability.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the stimulus checks to become a reality, Republicans in Congress would need to approve the policy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the legal complexities, <a href=\"https://x.com/ericadyork/status/1987519882351841674\"  target=\"_blank\">experts have also raised issues with the math</a> behind Trump&rsquo;s proposal, citing the total cost of the stimulus checks would likely exceed any amount raised by the tariffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&rsquo;s also the lingering uncertainty over the tariffs themselves&mdash;and the legal challenges they face, Cummings notes. The Supreme Court is <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/11/05/us/trump-tariffs-supreme-court\"  target=\"_blank\">still undecided</a> on whether Trump&rsquo;s use of an emergency law to impose tariffs without Congressional approval was legal. The Court is issuing rulings on Friday in some cases, but it has yet to reveal which ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Should the Trump Administration lose the case, there is a possibility that the Administration would have to refund the tariffs to importers, thus lessening the likelihood of Americans seeing the returns on those promised dividends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if the Trump Administration does backtrack on the possibility of a $2,000 check, Cummings predicts there could be repercussions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Trump has caused himself a lot of harm by over-promising and under-delivering,&rdquo; he says, citing the affordability crisis as a prime example. &ldquo;A lot of people actually change their economic behavior if they anticipate a check. So if that $2,000 doesn&#8217;t materialize, I think people are going to express a lot of frustration.&rdquo;</p>\n",

The goal, he said, is to prevent corruption and ensure the money benefits ordinary Venezuelans.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We are going to take between 30 and 50 million barrels of oil,&rdquo; Rubio said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to sell it in the marketplace at market rates, not at the discounts Venezuela was getting. That money will then be handled in such a way that we will control how it is disbursed in a way that benefits the Venezuelan people, not corruption, not the regime.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio&rsquo;s comments offered the most detailed public explanation yet of the Administration&rsquo;s plans for Venezuela, outlining how the U.S. intends to use control of the country&rsquo;s oil revenue to shape what comes next. He described the oil plan as the first phase of a broader, three-step strategy for Venezuela: stabilization, recovery, and transition. The Administration is starting with stabilization, Rubio said, because &ldquo;we don&rsquo;t want it descending into chaos.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked how much this effort would cost U.S. taxpayers, he replied, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not going to cost us anything.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The remarks came as the U.S. military sharply escalated its pressure on Venezuela&rsquo;s oil exports. On Wednesday, <a href=\"https://time.com/7344321/venezuela-russian-flagged-oil-tanker-us-seizure/\" >American forces seized two tankers</a> carrying Venezuelan crude, including a Russian-flagged vessel that had been evading U.S. authorities for weeks. One ship was intercepted in the North Atlantic between Scotland and Iceland for violating U.S. sanctions, while another&mdash;a stateless &ldquo;dark fleet&rdquo; tanker&mdash;was apprehended in international waters in the Caribbean and escorted to the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Together, the tanker seizures and what Rubio has called an American &ldquo;quarantine&rdquo; of Venezuelan oil are designed to choke off exports that have long been the country&rsquo;s primary source of revenue. If the United States ultimately takes control of 30 million to 50 million barrels&mdash;roughly two months of Venezuela&rsquo;s typical production&mdash;it would be worth an estimated $1.8 billion to $3 billion at current prices. It remains unclear what exactly Venezuela would receive in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio confirmed that the interim Venezuelan leadership wants one of the seized tankers&rsquo; cargo to be folded into the broader oil deal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;They understand that the only way they can move oil and generate revenue and not have economic collapse is if they cooperate and work with the United States,&rdquo; he said, adding that the administration was &ldquo;about to execute on a deal.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://time.com/7343035/delcy-rodriguez-venezuela-president/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Who is Delcy Rodr&iacute;guez, Venezuela&rsquo;s New Leader? </em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the recovery phase, Rubio said the Trump Administration wants to ensure that &ldquo;American, Western and other companies have access to the Venezuelan market in a way that&rsquo;s fair,&rdquo; while also beginning a process of national reconciliation. That would include amnesty for opposition figures, the release of political prisoners, and efforts to rebuild civil society, he said. The final phase would be a transition led by Venezuelans themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;In the end, it will be up to the Venezuelan people to transform their country,&rdquo; Rubio said, adding that &ldquo;more deals&rdquo; with the interim government were expected, though he declined to provide details.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the Senate briefing room, Administration officials laid out those plans in more<strong> </strong>detail, lawmakers from both parties said afterward. But the mood was divided. Republican Senators largely praised the strategy and the leverage created by the oil crackdown. Sen. Roger Marshall of Kansas said the &ldquo;big leverage&rdquo; was controlling the flow of oil and money. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Rubio&rsquo;s discussion of phased plans was &ldquo;instructive,&rdquo; though he declined to elaborate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Democrats were far more skeptical. Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut called the plan &ldquo;insane&rdquo; and said that the Trump Administration is &ldquo;proposing to steal Venezuela&#8217;s oil at gun point forever and use that leverage to run the country.&rdquo; Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont warned that history showed regimes were often willing to impose immense suffering on their own citizens to stay in power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said he was &ldquo;totally dissatisfied&rdquo; with the Administration&rsquo;s answers and accused the Administration of relying on &ldquo;the most unreliable corrupt people&rdquo; to help govern Venezuela and warned that the strategy was &ldquo;fraught with peril.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The American people need answers,&rdquo; Schumer said as he called for public hearings. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re avoiding all public discussion to talk to us in this SCIF [Sensitive Compartmented Information Facility] where we didn&rsquo;t get adequate answers even to our questions.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Beyond Washington, conditions inside Venezuela remain tense. Armed pro-government militias known as <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/07/caracas-venezuela-paramilitary-groups\"  target=\"_blank\">colectivos</a> have been deployed across Caracas in recent days, with residents reporting interrogations and phone searches for signs of support for the U.S. intervention, according to a Venezuelan journalist in Caracas who spoke with TIME. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://time.com/7343019/venezuela-trump-oil-china/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>How Trump&rsquo;s Venezuela Takeover Could Change the World</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the White House, press secretary Karoline Leavitt said significant private-sector interest was emerging around Venezuela&rsquo;s oil industry as the Administration worked with the interim government.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a lot of private sector engagement that&rsquo;s happening right now,&rdquo; Leavitt said, noting that Energy Secretary Chris Wright was meeting with oil executives and would host more discussions at the White House later this week. She said President Trump was expected to meet with oil industry leaders on Friday to discuss what she called &ldquo;the immense opportunity that is before these oil companies right now.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump is still open to using more military force inside Venezuela if the remnants of Maduro&rsquo;s government now running the country don&rsquo;t comply with his demands, Leavitt said. &ldquo;At this point in time, as you know, there are no troops on the ground in Venezuela,&rdquo; said Leavitt, who added, &ldquo;Diplomacy is always the first option. As you saw, he tried that with Nicol&aacute;s Maduro but unfortunately he is an illegitimate dictator and an unserious person.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The use of armed pro-government militias inside Venezuela to find and intimidate people supportive of Maduro&rsquo;s ouster &ldquo;would not be consistent&rdquo; with Trump&rsquo;s expectations for the interim government, Leavitt said.</p>\n",

Literally. In the U.S., data centers burn through more than 4% of total annual energy consumption, <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/short-reads/2025/10/24/what-we-know-about-energy-use-at-us-data-centers-amid-the-ai-boom/#how-much-energy-do-data-centers-use\"  target=\"_blank\">says</a> the Pew Research Center&mdash;a figure that is expected to grow by more than 130% by the end of this decade. And all that power generates a lot of heat. A large data center campus can throw off up to <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/analysis/heat-reuse-it-is-time-it-meant-business/#:~:text=The%20big%20picture,10%20Mar%202021\"  target=\"_blank\">100 megawatts of waste heat</a>, sufficient to power <a href=\"https://ourgreatminds.com/2023/03/09/understanding-megawatts-of-power-mws-role-in-renewable-energy-industry/#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20100%2Dmegawatt,source%2C%20and%20the%20environmental%20conditions.\"  target=\"_blank\">100,000 homes</a>.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Things are likely only to get hotter. Even before the AI boom, in 2021 <a href=\"https://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/executive_briefings/ebot_data_centers_around_the_world.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">there were 8,000 data centers of various sizes worldwide</a>&mdash;a number that <a href=\"https://www.cargoson.com/en/blog/number-of-data-centers-by-country\"  target=\"_blank\">has leapt to 12,000</a> in just the past five years. <a href=\"https://www.techrepublic.com/article/news-only-32-countries-host-data-centers-2025/#:~:text=Only%2032%20countries%20have%20AI,behind%20in%20the%20AI%20revolution.&amp;text=As%20artificial%20intelligence%20becomes%20the,countries%20lack%20such%20infrastructure%20altogether.\"  target=\"_blank\">More than 30 countries</a> are home to AI data centers. The U.S. leads the pack in data center count at 5,426, <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/sustainable-data-centre-heating/\"  target=\"_blank\">according to</a> the World Economic Forum. The next closest country, Germany, has 529.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, the solution to managing all this heat is water, which serves as a coolant at data centers. The biggest centers use <a href=\"https://www.tulanewater.org/post/the-thirstiest-of-us-all-data-centers-and-the-impact-of-their-unsustainable-water-use#:~:text=Large%2C%20or%20%E2%80%9Chyperscale%E2%80%9D%20data,the%20expanded%20power%20production%20needed.\"  target=\"_blank\">five million gallons of water per day</a>&mdash;matching the daily needs of 1,000 homes. <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/09/18/energy-ai-use-electricity-water-data-centers/\"  target=\"_blank\">According to a study by <em>The Washington Post</em></a>, typing and sending a 100-word email requires the equivalent of a half-liter bottle of water. And up to 56% of the energy used to power data centers comes from fossil fuels, <a href=\"https://www.eesi.org/articles/view/data-center-energy-needs-are-upending-power-grids-and-threatening-the-climate#:~:text=About%2056%25%20of%20the%20electricity,projected%20electricity%20demand%20in%202030\"  target=\"_blank\">according to</a> the Environmental Energy and Study Institute.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Something, clearly, has got to give. By 2028, global data creation is projected to exceed <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2025/06/sustainable-data-centre-heating/\"  target=\"_blank\">400 zettabytes</a>&mdash;with a single zettabyte equalling one sextillion bytes of data. The already overheated planet can&rsquo;t afford the fossil-fuel and water costs needed to sustain and maintain that kind of processing. Increasingly, the answer is to take the data centers off-planet entirely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In just the past three years, a scrum of companies, including established outfits like Blue Origin, Google, and <a href=\"https://www.geekwire.com/2025/openai-ceo-stoke-space-data-center/\"  target=\"_blank\">Open AI</a>, as well as multiple startups, have been eyeing space as a clean, next-generation solution to the data-center energy and cooling problem. If all goes to plan, by the early 2030s many&mdash;or even most&mdash;data centers will be flying overhead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When it comes to energy creation and heat dissipation, space is a very sweet place. Put your data-processing satellite in just the right orbit and you will have constant exposure to sunlight&mdash;which solar panels can convert to bottomless energy. And position your radiators on the shaded side of your spacecraft and you can simply dump any amount of excess heat into the vast, -250&deg;F environment of space. Yes, it would take a lot of satellites&mdash;a constellation of hundreds&mdash;to match the might of campus-sized data centers on Earth, but manufacturing them could actually be easier than constructing a terrestrial data center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Getting utility connections, doing negotiations with local power providers, and actually operating a terrestrial data center can take five to eight years to bring online,&rdquo; says Baiju Bhatt, founder and CEO of <a href=\"https://www.aetherflux.com/\"  target=\"_blank\">Aetherflux</a>, a space-based energy-production and data-processing company. With satellites, he says, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;more akin to producing a car off an assembly line.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those satellites would not be prohibitively expensive to build, but launch costs could be astronomical. As an <a href=\"https://spacenews.com/beyond-the-horizon-cost-driven-strategies-for-space-based-data-centers/#:~:text=Meanwhile%2C%20corporate%20and%20industry%20leaders%20should%20adopt,operational%20expense%20for%20terrestrial%20data%20centers%2C%20often\"  target=\"_blank\">analysis by SpaceNews</a> explains, the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket, one of the most affordable rides to space, charges customers about $2,500 per kilogram of payload. Launching just 1,000 kg (over 2,200 lbs.) of solar arrays would thus cost $2.5 million&mdash;and there would be a great, great many solar arrays and a great many satellites needed to get a data center up and flying. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But orbital systems make up that cost after the launch phase. Running a terrestrial data center costs up to $10 million per year in electricity needs alone. For a space-based solar-powered system that figure is $0. The five million gallons of water a terrestrial data center uses for cooling does not come cheap either. The cost per thousand gallons of water for a commercial user in the U.S. is $6.13, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/watersense/data-and-information-used-watersense#:~:text=Table_title:%20Cost%20of%20Water%20Table_content:%20header:%20%7C,Combined%20Water%20&amp;%20Wastewater/1%2C000%20gallons:%20$13.36%20%7C\"  target=\"_blank\">according to</a> the Environmental Protection Agency. That factors out to more than $11 million per year to slake a terrestrial data center&rsquo;s thirst. Here again, the cost in space is $0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riding that hope of practicality and affordability, in November, 2025 a first data satellite went aloft, <a href=\"https://www.starcloud.com/\"  target=\"_blank\">courtesy of Starcloud</a>, a space startup based in Redmond, Washington. The refrigerator-sized satellite&mdash;equipped with an AI brain&mdash;was launched aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket into a very precise and particular orbit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most satellites fly a more or less equatorial route around the planet&rsquo;s waistline, during which they experience 16 sunrises and sunsets every day, as they pass alternatingly through the Earth&rsquo;s daytime and nighttime sky. Solar panels can keep a ship operating when it&rsquo;s exposed to the sun; batteries kick in when it&rsquo;s not. That works fine, but batteries are pricey. &ldquo;Batteries are one of the biggest expenses for a solar project,&rdquo; says Starcloud CEO Philip Johnston.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, to keep costs down and power up, the Starcloud satellite flies what is known as a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Dusk-Dawn-Sun-Synchronous-orbit-and-the-ground-track-associated_fig2_368544242\"  target=\"_blank\">dawn-dusk sun-synchronous orbit</a>, circling the planet at a near vertical 83&deg; angle that carries it over the poles and keeps it almost constantly exposed to the sun. It is also constantly exposed to users on the ground who could access the satellite for data processing. The Starcloud ship has not gone into service yet, but it cheekily announced its presence to Earth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the first thing you&rsquo;d like me to do?&rdquo; <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/10/nvidia-backed-starcloud-trains-first-ai-model-in-space-orbital-data-centers.html\"  target=\"_blank\">it asked its Starcloud operators</a> in December, 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I need a witty first statement from you, as the very first AI running in space,&rdquo; the human user responded.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Greetings Earthlings!&rdquo; the satellite complied. &ldquo;Or as I prefer to think of you, a fascinating collection of blue and green. Let&rsquo;s see what wonders this view of the world holds.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That kind of human-computer back and forth can be impressive, but it&rsquo;s little more than a parlor trick compared to what a fully scaled orbiting data center could do. By the early 2030s, Starcloud envisions having a four-km by four-km (2.5-mi. by 2.5-mi.) mega-structure in orbit composed of hundreds of individual satellites docked to a truss and a massive array of solar wings. That one facility, Johnston says, could replace about 50 data centers on Earth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Construction won&rsquo;t be easy. Johnston predicts that it will take about 100 launches of SpaceX&rsquo;s massive Starship rocket to get all of the hardware aloft&mdash;and Starship has fallen behind in development, <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/why-do-spacexs-starships-keep-exploding/#:~:text=A%20Starship%20Super%20Heavy%20booster,and%20gets%20lit%20on%20fire.\"  target=\"_blank\">with serial explosions</a> plaguing its test flights. But SpaceX has a proven record as a reliable launch service, once it gets a ship flying. The company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.spacex.com/vehicles/falcon-9\"  target=\"_blank\">Falcon 9 rocket</a> has completed a staggering 582 missions since its first launch in 2010, making it the world&rsquo;s workhorse booster. Still, Johnston admits, eventual users of a Starcloud data center will have to be patient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;If you want my real answer,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not going to be docking anything for quite a long time.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also in the hunt is Baiju Bhatt&rsquo;s Aetherflux. Later this year, the company plans to launch its first test satellite&mdash;one it hopes will be joined by hundreds more before the decade is out. Like Starcloud, it will fly a sun-synchronous orbit; and like Starcloud it plans to rely on Starship to launch flocks of satellites at once. Unlike Starcloud, it does not plan to build a discrete orbiting structure, but rather constellations of free-flying satellites, communicating with one another. The satellites would be a lot bigger than Starcloud&rsquo;s&mdash;about 185 square meters, or, as Bhatt says, &ldquo;the equivalent of 11 parking spaces. I do all of my spreadsheets in terms of car parking spots.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before entering the data center game, Bhatt was working on the technology of space-based power generation&mdash;using satellites to collect and store the power of the sun and transmitting it back down to Earth. In many cases, that power would be used to operate terrestrial data centers, and that whole multi-step process felt wasteful to Bhatt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Rather than beaming the power down to the ground and then converting it back to electricity to run a data center, the more efficient sort of first principles approach would be to put the data center on the satellite,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;You put the chips right next to the power generation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Google is taking a similar approach. The planners behind the company&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://blog.google/technology/research/google-project-suncatcher/\"  target=\"_blank\">Project Suncatcher</a> envision clusters of satellites flying in close formation just hundreds of meters to a kilometer (.62 mi.)&nbsp; apart. &ldquo;That close formation facilitates really high bandwidth, low latency communication between all of the satellites,&rdquo; says Google&rsquo;s Travis Beals, whose business card marvelously reads &ldquo;senior director, paradigms of intelligence.&rdquo; Each cluster would be part of a larger cluster of clusters, exponentially increasing the collective processing power. &ldquo;Imagine a string of pearls in Earth orbit,&rdquo; Beals says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not all AI infrastructure in space would involve processing data; some would simply be about storing it. Imagine a catastrophic government-wide or industry-wide data crash&mdash;due either to cyber collapse or cyber attack. Somehow, Washington or the commercial sector would have to reboot, restoring data on payroll, salaries, taxation, human resources, intelligence, law enforcement, military deployment, and more. Best to keep backups of all of that data stashed, cached, and out of harm&rsquo;s way&mdash;and space makes an ideal safe deposit box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024 and 2025, Houston-based aerospace company <a href=\"https://www.intuitivemachines.com/about\"  target=\"_blank\">Intuitive Machines</a> launched <a href=\"https://www.intuitivemachines.com/im-1\"  target=\"_blank\">two</a> <a href=\"https://www.intuitivemachines.com/im-2\"  target=\"_blank\">spacecraft</a> to the surface of the moon. Both landed intact but both also tipped over in the uneven lunar footing. Still, most of the instruments and other equipment inside survived, and on both missions that included AI data storage vaults built by <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/lonestar-data-holdings/\"  target=\"_blank\">Lonestar Data Holdings</a> of St. Petersburg, Fla., which remain on the moon with the two spacecraft today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Even when they fell over the software worked,&rdquo; says Chris Stott, Lonestar&rsquo;s founder and executive chairman. &ldquo;We transmitted the Declaration of Independence as our first document to be stored off-planet.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lonestar has configured two more data storage systems aboard the International Space Station and Stott sees a growing need for the services his company provides. He envisions storing data in low-Earth orbit, on the moon, and in cislunar space&mdash;the void between the Earth and the moon. Climate change and the natural disasters that result increase the need for all of these storage sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;When a [2022] <a href=\"https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/outage-at-london-hospitals-cost-nhs-14m-when-heatwave-brought-down-two-data-centers/\"  target=\"_blank\">heat wave hit London</a>,&rdquo; Stott says, &ldquo;Google&rsquo;s and Oracle&rsquo;s batteries melted. The National Health Service <a href=\"https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/guys-st-thomas-heatwave-2022-critical-incident-review/#:~:text=In%20July%202022%2C%20both%20hospitals',response%20cost%20the%20hospitals%20%C2%A31.4m.\"  target=\"_blank\">was offline</a> for weeks, which means people passed away because they couldn&rsquo;t get into operating [rooms].&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There remain two unavoidable concerns for the growing space-data sector. Chemical rockets put out huge plumes of polluting exhaust, and for a massive machine like the SpaceX Starship, with 33 first-stage engines, that can add up&mdash;especially with hundreds of launches planned. But proponents of the industry claim that the environmental costs still net out as a plus since the space data centers take processing off the fossil-fuel-burning grid.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s so environmentally helpful,&rdquo; says Stott. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d really rather not build a five gigawatt data center in Louisiana; I&rsquo;d rather that be parkland.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Space-based data centers would also add to the growing belt of satellites, spent rocket boosters, and related junk that increasingly crowd low-Earth orbit. The flying mess creates the ever-present risk of high-speed collisions that could set off a cascade, known as the <a href=\"https://www.esa.int/Enabling_Support/Space_Engineering_Technology/The_Kessler_Effect_and_how_to_stop_it\"  target=\"_blank\">Kessler Effect</a>, in which the debris from one satellite strikes multiple other satellites which in turn produce more destructive debris of their own and on and on. The data center industry does not have a terribly good answer for this, except that their 83&deg; sun-synchronous orbit is much less crowded than equatorial ones, meaning a lower risk of collisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meantime, other players&mdash;some very big&mdash;are likely to join the data storage and processing scramble. In December, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/bezos-and-musk-race-to-bring-data-centers-to-space-faa486ee?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqe5NAbctaoweoijXbvKYBwhcLubRljOT9UyFli5OLjBi6L7osYDCNH-dd6KpSk%3D&amp;gaa_ts=695d4600&amp;gaa_sig=XmJJA1dJT4egoAg5zlJeiszpsFj5aFpqbZPmux6b1f8iwL9k2B3GeA_RBkCT98G9K8X7p-3pqChdyF_v7jYbHw%3D%3D\"  target=\"_blank\"><em>The Wall Street Journal</em></a> reported that <a href=\"https://www.blueorigin.com/\"  target=\"_blank\">Blue Origin</a>, the company founded by Amazon&rsquo;s Jeff Bezos, has been quietly working on its own data storage spacecraft for the past year.

And ones that the president appears to be working hard to uphold. According to Reuters, oil industry executives claim that Chevron, ConocoPhillips, and ExxonMobil leaders have not yet had any conversations with the administration about Maduro, contradicting Trump&rsquo;s statement that he had held meetings with &ldquo;all&rdquo; U.S. oil companies. On Tuesday it was <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/trump-administration-has-not-consulted-us-oil-majors-about-venezuela-oil-execs-2026-01-05/\"  target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that Trump aims to meet with U.S. oil executives later this week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The question now becomes whether this is an opportunity the oil companies even want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday the markets reacted quickly and positively, with the S&amp;P 500 energy index rising to its highest since March 2025; ExxonMobil rose 2.2% and Chevron jumped 5.1%. Oil prices also fell<strong>  </strong>with Brent crude dropping 61 cents, or 1%, to $60.09 a barrel on Wednesday after Trump said Tuesday that Venezuela would be &#8220;turning over&#8221; 30 million to 50 million oil barrels to the U.S. Though that range may sound expansive, in 2023, the U.S. consumed an average of about 20.25 million barrels per day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Experts, however, caution the situation is much more complicated than the president might imply, and oil stocks lost steam on Tuesday after their Monday rally, undoing some of the previous day&rsquo;s gains. And even oil companies are being initially cautious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amrita Sen, founder and director of market intelligence at Energy Aspects, a global research group advising businesses on energy markets, tells TIME that questions around when Venezuela&rsquo;s oil will flow may be answered in due time, but many things need to occur long before infrastructure is built back up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&#8217;ve had comments from the U.S. administration saying that the U.S. companies would go in and spend billions of dollars, or hundreds of billions of dollars, but when you&#8217;re talking to the companies, that&#8217;s not what <em>they</em> are saying,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;They&#8217;re extremely cautious, not in a rush to go back, because, again, they don&#8217;t know who they&#8217;re dealing with.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Currently, Chevron is the only major U.S. firm still operating in Venezuela through joint ventures with state oil company PDVSA. Other U.S. companies like ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips do not have ventures in Venezuela, as sanctions remain in place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of these companies have been tight-lipped in their response to Maduro&rsquo;s capture and Trump&rsquo;s claims. &ldquo;Chevron remains focused on the safety and wellbeing of our employees, as well as the integrity of our assets. We continue to operate in full compliance with all relevant laws and regulations,&rdquo; Bill Turenne, head of public policy communications at Chevron told TIME via email.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;ConocoPhillips is monitoring developments in Venezuela and their potential implications for global energy supply and stability,&rdquo; a ConocoPhillips spokesperson said in an email. &ldquo;It would be premature to speculate on any future business activities or investments.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Companies operating refineries along the Gulf Coast, however, stand to receive a big boost if Venezuela&#8217;s oil industry does re-open, including Phillips 66 whose CEO said at a Goldman Sachs conference Tuesday that they have two Gulf coast refineries which can turn and process Venezuela crude oil as production ramps up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One oil company, Continental Resources, has also publicly indicated its interest in working with the government in Venezuela. It is led by top Trump ally and tycoon Harold Hamm, who told the Financial <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/67c43f17-dbe4-42b3-be8d-6351ab842b06\"  target=\"_blank\"><em>Times</em></a> that &ldquo;with improved regulatory and governmental stability we would definitely consider future investment.&rdquo; On the day of Trump&rsquo;s inauguration, <a href=\"https://time.com/7209181/fossil-fuel-billionaires-wealth-trump-inauguration/\" >Hamm</a> hosted a watch party that included fellow oil executives, as well as Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen says that overall, though, many of the companies&rsquo; reluctance is for good reason. While the country boasts the world&rsquo;s largest proven oil reserves with around 303 billion barrels of crude oil, it <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelan-oil-industry-worlds-largest-reserves-decaying-infrastructure-2026-01-03/\"  target=\"_blank\">currently produces</a> less than 1 million barrels of oil per day, or about 0.5% of global oil production&mdash;only half of which is exported out of South America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Its energy infrastructure has been hampered by years of sanctions and mismanagement. Beyond the political uncertainty, this situation might prevent oil companies from investing. Sen says she cannot &ldquo;stress enough how difficult it will be&rdquo; to build production by even half a million barrels, let alone the levels Trump is promising.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It needs gas processing. The damage is unbelievable that has happened over the years, and the brain drain is phenomenal as well,&rdquo; Sen says. On top of this, Venezuela&#8217;s oil is extra-heavy oil, viscous and thick with a higher sulfur and carbon content than conventional crude, leading Trump to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iL2SlXzrzoE\"  target=\"_blank\">describe</a> it as the &#8220;probably the dirtiest in the world.&#8221; As a result, the oil is more difficult and expensive to extract, as Sen notes, and it needs massive amounts of lighter oil to allow it to flow. &ldquo;To raise production by half a million barrels per day takes two years and $10 billion, and if you were to go and increase production back to two and a half million barrels per day, it would take seven to 10 years and hundreds of billions of dollars.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marcos Falcone, a policy analyst focusing on Latin America at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, says that the swing in the market response is because, essentially, not much has changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;It&#8217;s not clear to me that markets are anticipating any huge changes in Venezuela. And I think there&#8217;s a good reason why that would be the case,&rdquo; he tells TIME, noting that Delcy Rodr&iacute;guez, who was sworn in as the nation&rsquo;s interim president on Monday, served under Maduro and is still not a democratically elected leader.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;She&#8217;s a Chavista,&rdquo; says Roxanna Vigil, international affairs fellow with the Committee on Foreign Relations. &ldquo;She is going to be in charge of trying to hold together a very fragile coalition of regime insiders that include hardliners, military, moderates, like all sorts of different interests, and she doesn&#8217;t have a strong mandate.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Vigil puts it, the Trump Administration is &ldquo;prioritizing rebuilding the oil sector over a political transition.&rdquo; Rodr&iacute;guez &ldquo;was not elected to lead,&rdquo; she continues. &ldquo;So I see just a really high risk of things quickly spiraling out of control politically in Venezuela.&rdquo; All of this political uncertainty might prevent the government from being able to tell investors with certainty where their money may be headed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, Rodr&iacute;guez already has a reputation with oil companies, as the former oil minister under Maduro. With developed relationships in the oil sector, Rodr&iacute;guez could easily be seen by Washington as a pragmatic member of Maduro&rsquo;s circle. And though she has condemned Maduro&rsquo;s capture as a &ldquo;kidnapping,&rdquo; she has since softened her defiance and said that the country is willing to work with Washington.</p>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\n",

The ship, previously known as the Bella 1 and recently renamed the Marinera, was not carrying oil at the time. Reuters first <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/us-seizing-venezuela-linked-oil-tanker-after-weeks-long-pursuit-2026-01-07/\"  target=\"_blank\">reported</a> the interception.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hours later, U.S. forces apprehended a second vessel, the M Sophia, described by the military as a &ldquo;stateless, sanctioned dark fleet motor tanker,&rdquo; in international waters in the Caribbean. Officials said the ship had been engaged in illicit activity and was being escorted to the United States for what they called final disposition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seizures came as Secretary of State Marco Rubio <a href=\"https://time.com/7344479/venezuela-oil-rubio-trump/\" >laid out</a> the most detailed public account yet of the administration&rsquo;s plans for Venezuela. Speaking at the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon, Rubio described a three-step approach that begins with stabilizing the country by seizing and selling between 30 million and 50 million barrels of Venezuelan oil&mdash;roughly two months of production&mdash;with the proceeds controlled by the United States rather than Venezuela&rsquo;s interim authorities. &ldquo;That gives us tremendous leverage,&rdquo; Rubio said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under the plan, he said, the U.S. would next ensure that certain companies have fair access to Venezuela&rsquo;s energy sector and would work to reintegrate opposition forces. A final phase, which he described only as a transition, would involve integrating opposition parties into a new political framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking at a conference with energy executives in Miami, U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright suggested that the U.S. would control the movement and sale of the country&rsquo;s oil &ldquo;indefinitely.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to &hellip; let the oil flow, sell that market to United States refineries and around the world to bring better oil supplies,&rdquo; Wright said. The U.S. must &ldquo;have that leverage and that control of those oil sales to drive the changes that simply must happen in Venezuela,&rdquo; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Funds from the sales, he added, will be placed in accounts controlled by the Trump Administration but would &ldquo;flow back into Venezuela to benefit the Venezuelan people.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Energy Department also said in a fact sheet posted online that the U.S. &ldquo;is selectively rolling back sanctions to enable the transport and sale of Venezuelan crude and oil products to global markets.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy exports are Venezuela&rsquo;s primary source of revenue, and a partial U.S. blockade imposed last month has already curtailed shipments. If the U.S. ultimately takes control of 30 million to 50 million barrels&mdash;roughly two months of Venezuela&rsquo;s typical production&mdash;it would be worth an estimated $1.8 billion to $3 billion at current prices. It remains unclear what exactly Venezuela would receive in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuela&rsquo;s state-owned oil company, Petroleos de Venezuela, <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/us-trump-updates-01-07-2026#0000019b-9a12-dc77-a1bb-de9e822e0000\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> Wednesday that it was engaged in talks with the Trump Administration to potentially allow it to sell the South American nation&rsquo;s oil. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump Administration ordered what it called a &ldquo;total and complete blockade&rdquo; of Venezuelan oil tankers in mid-December, a move intended to force Venezuela&rsquo;s long-time president Nicol&aacute;s Maduro from office. Although Maduro has since been captured and is facing charges in the United States, Trump has pledged to keep the blockade in place to pressure Venezuela&rsquo;s interim government and to control the flow of oil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said Wednesday that Trump is &ldquo;not afraid&rdquo; to continue seizing sanctioned oil tankers despite concerns that it could inflame tensions between the U.S. and Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to enforce our policy that&rsquo;s best for the United States of America,&rdquo; she told reporters. &ldquo;That means enforcing the embargo against all dark fleet vessels that are illegally transporting oil.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. officials told <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/russia/russia-sends-submarine-to-escort-tanker-the-u-s-tried-to-seize-off-venezuela-4bd78dc7?gaa_at=eafs&amp;gaa_n=AWEtsqevDg0dL1uyQ_J2MZbAWgE-amEnwgZCoZiMQuuy89KnX3oNncCzA0e6DjZrD78%3D&amp;gaa_ts=695e7abb&amp;gaa_sig=aTENOQlNSA1NjhNUBDTixP674_1VXNYoJoAA5g5SR-Jh0ZRYlK0VClnxAqKAi99K3rNCngwwAih5U7FKwiTWeg%3D%3D\"  target=\"_blank\">multiple</a> <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/us-operation-seize-venezuela-linked-oil-tanker-marinera/\"  target=\"_blank\">outlets</a> that Russia had sent a submarine and other naval vessels to safeguard and escort the tanker during the pursuit by U.S. forces. The New York <em>Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2026/01/07/world/venezuela-us-trump/29aad0d3-10b1-564a-9ed4-8baca5d5ce8c?smid=url-share\"  target=\"_blank\">reported</a>, citing two officials, that no Russian vessels were in the vicinity when it was seized, however. The U.S. Coast Guard attempted to board the tanker, which is accused of breaking U.S. sanctions and transporting Iranian oil headed to Venezuela, in the Caribbean last month. The vessel refused to be boarded, turned away, and fled. It then changed its name to the Marinera and re-registered as a Russian vessel.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. previously <a href=\"https://sanctionssearch.ofac.treas.gov/Details.aspx?id=49244\"  target=\"_blank\">sanctioned</a> the tanker in 2024 over alleged links to Iran-backed militant groups across the Middle East, including the Houthis and Hezbollah. Its seizure follows a more than two-week long pursuit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Russian officials condemned the seizure, arguing that it violated international law. &ldquo;No state has the right to use force against ships properly registered in the jurisdictions of other states,&rdquo; Russia&rsquo;s transport ministry said, citing the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. The United States has not ratified the convention but generally treats its provisions as customary law.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The two seizures come less than a week after the U.S. military captured Maduro in a <a href=\"https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/\" >massive military operation</a> following months of escalating pressure against the Venezuelan government.</p>\n",

European leaders believe the White House is preparing to do just that, as the White House <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cwyg1jg8xkmo\"  target=\"_blank\">says</a> it is discussing a &ldquo;range of options.&rdquo;</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>For Europeans, the U.S. is now a predatory regime. The Trump Administration <a href=\"https://www.dw.com/en/how-trumps-outreach-to-europes-far-right-fits-into-his-national-security-strategy/a-75092824\"  target=\"_blank\">supports</a> MAGA allied far-right parties across the continent that many European leaders believe pose an existential threat to their democracies.

Normalizing economic relations with Russia <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/us/politics/trump-zelensky-putin-ukraine-russia.html\"  target=\"_blank\">remains a goal</a> for Trump&rsquo;s team. And yet, many European leaders refuse to accept this reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More: </strong><em><a href=\"https://time.com/7340472/trump-us-europe-transatlantic-alliance/\" >How Europe Can Find Its Strength in 2026</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reason? Europe remains hugely dependent upon the U.S. for its own security. The continent&rsquo;s rearmament, a process that <a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2025/769566/EPRS_BRI(2025)769566_EN.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">began in earnest last year</a>, will take at least three to five years to be credible. Until then, Europe will be highly dependent on <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/en/international/article/2025/09/04/europe-is-now-ukraine-s-main-source-of-military-support_6745030_4.html\"  target=\"_blank\">U.S. weapons</a>, kit, intelligence, and other strategic enablers to keep Ukraine in the fight. And they will remain hugely dependant on the U.S., through NATO, to deter Russia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump Administration sees Europe&rsquo;s weakness and its vulnerabilities and is exploiting them. It did so last year, forcing the Europeans to accept a <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cx2xylk3d07o\"  target=\"_blank\">15% tariff</a> on their exports to America in order to avoid alienating Trump and hastening a unilateral U.S. exit from Ukraine and NATO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The White House is deploying that playbook again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the annexation of Greenland would shatter the illusion that America remains a friend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Donald Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, recently appointed special envoy to Greenland Jeff Landry, and White House Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4g0zg974v1o\"  target=\"_blank\">have</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/carlbildt/status/2004827650343469499?s=46\"  target=\"_blank\">all</a> <a href=\"https://x.com/lagovjefflandry/status/2002950029494124986?s=46\"  target=\"_blank\">spoken</a> <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/stephen-miller-trump-greenland-venezuela-b2895069.html\"  target=\"_blank\">provocatively</a> about Greenland&rsquo;s territory in recent days. Senior U.S. officials argue the White House has legitimate security concerns in the Artic region. These include countering <a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/2025/10/when-it-comes-arctic-security-europe-must-not-forget-about-economics\"  target=\"_blank\">Russian and Chinese bases there</a>; bolstering the <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory/trump-us-greenland-arctic-security-128939917\"  target=\"_blank\">U.S.&rsquo;s missile defenses</a> to constrain China&rsquo;s new capabilities; controlling access during wartime and expanding the U.S.&rsquo;s Naval presence. They don&rsquo;t fully trust the Greenlanders or Danes to manage these on the U.S.&rsquo;s behalf. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The seriousness of these American anxieties is reflected by the amount of <a href=\"https://www.highnorthnews.com/en/white-house-draws-plans-acquire-greenland-trump-revives-territorial-ambitions\"  target=\"_blank\">policy planning</a> taking place on Greenland across U.S. government agencies, involving work on economic incentives, diplomatic and legal agreements, and security arrangements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is true that Denmark is a small country with relatively limited military capabilities, even if it spent a sizable 3% of its GDP on defense in 2025 and is <a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/10/11/denmark-to-boost-arctic-defence-by-4-26bn-plans-to-buy-16-new-f-35s\"  target=\"_blank\">investing in the Arctic</a>. But the Island is also part of NATO&rsquo;s territory and senior European officials tell me that all of Trump&rsquo;s security goals can easily be met. There is no opposition to more U.S. bases on the Island; security and defense co-operation is also underpinned by U.S.-Danish bilateral arrangements; and the U.S. already enjoys substantial military access and base-operating authority on the Island since 1951.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if the U.S.&rsquo;s interest in Greenland is largely economic, the exploitation of the territory&rsquo;s minerals and rare earths is already open to American investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is why many European leaders fear there is little they can do to defuse this crisis, because a far cruder and sinister goal is at play: territorial expansion and real estate. Trump appears to driven by a desire to enlarge America on the map.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More: </strong><em><a href=\"https://time.com/7344147/greenland-denmark-trump-takeover-independence-purchase-military-nato/\" >The Ways Trump Could Try to Take Denmark</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This would likely come about not by not boots on the ground, but political and economic coercion to influence the 57,000 Greenlanders directly and politically, <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-greenland-easy-steps-nato-policy-deal-military/\"  target=\"_blank\">perhaps by a referendum</a>, so the U.S. can claim civilian&mdash;and not only military&mdash;sovereignty over the Island.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Europeans have no good answers for what they would do if the U.S. attempted to annex Greenland&rsquo;s territory in this way. It could attempt to forge ahead with a &ldquo;European NATO.&rdquo; It could slow down the pace of its <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/in-depth-research-reports/report/is-europe-waking-up-to-the-china-challenge-how-geopolitics-are-reshaping-eu-and-transatlantic-strategy/\"  target=\"_blank\">de-risking from China</a> to seek an alliance with Beijing. But a more credible option would be to put pressure on Copenhagen to come to some form of amicable arrangement with the White House&mdash;so long as U.S. aims could be tempered and rationalized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until now, the goal of the Danish government has been to keep Greenland out of the headlines; to wait it out and keep a cool head. That strategy has now changed. Copenhagen is trying to raise the costs&mdash;to the U.S. of moving any plan forward, and to the rest of Europe, of sitting on the fence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is why Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen pointedly <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/nato-done-if-us-donald-trump-invades-greenland-denmark-pm-mette-frederiksen-warns/\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> that, &ldquo;if the U.S. chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops, including NATO and thus the security that has been established since the end of the Second World War.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A U.S.-imposed annexation of Greenland, even with a bombardment of dollars, not missiles, would be one humiliation too far the Europeans. Frederiksen is right: a U.S. landgrab would be the end of the Alliance, and do irreperable damage to the E.U. </p>\n",

Especially as he is <a href=\"https://time.com/7343574/trump-impeachment-calls-gather-pace-venezuela-fallout/\" >facing loud calls for impeachment</a> from the Democratic Party on account of his <a href=\"https://time.com/7343053/trump-goals-venezuela-dont-add-up/\" >Venezuela operation</a> that resulted in the capture of fallen President Nicol&aacute;s Maduro and his wife, <a href=\"https://time.com/7343188/who-is-cilia-flores-maduro-wife-venezuela-politics/\" >Cilia Flores</a>.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Yet there is currently a split forming, as some prominent Republican lawmakers are publicly disagreeing with Trump regarding his renewed annexation threats against Greenland in the wake of the Venezuela intervention. In a series of inflammatory remarks labeled as &ldquo;utterly unacceptable&rdquo; by <a href=\"https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/\" >Greenland&rsquo;s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen</a>, Trump reasserted his stance that Greenland, a self-governing territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, should be under U.S. jurisdiction, citing it as a &ldquo;national security situation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When discussing his desire to <a href=\"https://time.com/7344147/greenland-denmark-trump-takeover-independence-purchase-military-nato/\" >acquire Greenland</a> last year, Trump notably <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/_9iHvFLUkpE\"  target=\"_blank\">refused to rule out military force</a> to annex the territory. That notion was revisited this week when the White House released a statement that said &ldquo;utilizing the &zwnj;U.S. military is &zwj;always an option at the commander-in-chief&#8217;s disposal.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s renewed fixation on Greenland&mdash;and his refusal to back down, despite the pleas of the territory&rsquo;s leadership&mdash;has now earned him rebuke from within his own party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;This is appalling. Greenland is a NATO ally. Denmark is one of our best friends&hellip; so the way we&rsquo;re treating them is really demeaning and it has no upside,&rdquo; Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska told CNN on Tuesday. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not going to acquire Greenland. I know most of those people in Greenland want to remain independent.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Referring to the Greenland rhetoric as one of the &ldquo;silliest things&rdquo; to come out of the White house over the past year, Bacon urged his fellow Republicans to join him in taking a stand. &ldquo;I hope other Republicans line up behind me and make it clear to the White House this is wrong,&rdquo; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some of the prominent Republicans who have publicly broken ranks with Trump over the contentious matter:</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lisa Murkowski voiced her concern on Tuesday, <a href=\"https://x.com/lisamurkowski/status/2008702152525705660\"  target=\"_blank\">arguing</a> that &ldquo;any effort to claim or take the territory by force would degrade both our national security and our international relationships.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Urging the protection of the long, historical alliance between the U.S. and Denmark, Murkowski added: &ldquo;We must see it [Greenland] as an ally, not an asset, and focus on continued partnership rather than possession.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/murkowski-greenland-oct8.jpg\" alt=\"Sen.

Don Bacon of Nebraska</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Bacon has issued a number of statements against the Trump Administration&rsquo;s Greenland approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bacon called out White House deputy chief of staff of policy Stephen Miller on Monday, after the staffer said: &ldquo;Greenland should be part of the US. By what right does Denmark assert control over Greenland? The U.S. is the power of NATO. Nobody is gonna fight the U.S. militarily over the future of Greenland.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bacon <a href=\"https://x.com/RepDonBacon/status/2008369618893590687\"  target=\"_blank\">referred</a> to the remarks as &ldquo;dumb,&rdquo; insisting that respect should be paid to Greenland and Denmark, as they are &ldquo;allies of the U.S.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response to a statement published by Denmark alongside fellow NATO members France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the United Kingdom, which showed support to Greenland, Bacon said it was &#8220;<a href=\"https://x.com/Statsmin/status/2008498610263257368\"  target=\"_blank\">embarrassing</a>&#8221; for the U.S. that such a statement had to be issued in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bacon-greenland-dec16.jpg\" alt=\"Don Bacon 12/16/25\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Sen.

In this moment, we need people to think boldly and collaborate courageously. However, Americans are currently facing devastating levels of <a href=\"https://time.com/6183058/loneliness-health-effects-what-to-do/\" >loneliness</a>, <a href=\"https://www.psychiatry.org/news-room/news-releases/annual-poll-adults-express-increasing-anxiousness\"  target=\"_blank\">anxiety</a>, and <a href=\"https://time.com/7337124/know-your-neighbors-save-democracy/\" >disconnection</a>. According to former U.S. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, loneliness now carries a mortality risk comparable to <a href=\"https://www.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/surgeon-general-social-connection-advisory.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">smoking 15 cigarettes a day.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While AI transforms everything from schools to boardrooms, we are ignoring the one human advantage no technology can replace: our capacity to connect.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Across classrooms, workplaces, and online spaces, we see a troubling pattern of brilliant minds constrained by systems that leave people unseen and pitted against one another. Students arrive on campus carrying extraordinary talent alongside profound doubts about whether they belong. Workers collaborate across distances without the structures that help trust grow. Online, <a href=\"https://time.com/7308120/secret-algorithms-behind-social-media/\" >algorithms</a> prioritize outrage rather than understanding, turning differences into divisions and disagreements into identity. The consequence is unmistakable: any system, whether a classroom or a social media platform, built on isolation will fail us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mcc.gse.harvard.edu/reports/loneliness-in-america\"  target=\"_blank\">More than 60%</a> of young adults report persistent loneliness. Over half of American workers say their workplace <a href=\"https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/new-survey-reveals-that-nearly-half-of-american-workers-are-considering-leaving-their-current-place-of-employment-301466289.html\"  target=\"_blank\">lacks real community</a>. Teen depression has nearly <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db527.htm\"  target=\"_blank\">doubled </a>over the last decade. Men face <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/products/databriefs/db464.htm\"  target=\"_blank\">soaring rates</a> of suicide, overdose, and isolation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This isn&rsquo;t just a socio-emotional crisis. It&rsquo;s a talent crisis, an innovation crisis, and yes, a democracy crisis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in STEM, the field responsible for solving humanity&rsquo;s hardest challenges, disconnection is slowing innovation and narrowing who participates in shaping a better future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connection sounds soft and is often treated as a &ldquo;nice-to-have,&rdquo; but in fact it is a competitive advantage. Teams with higher trust, psychological safety, and belonging <a href=\"https://www.michigan.gov/-/media/Project/Websites/mdhhs/Folder4/Folder10/Folder3/Folder110/Folder2/Folder210/Folder1/Folder310/Google-and-Psychological-Safety.pdf?rev=7786b2b9ade041e78828f839eccc8b75\"  target=\"_blank\">consistently outperform</a> those with more raw talent but less connection.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the power of connection: it rewrites what&rsquo;s possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet today, many programs which have expanded opportunity and strengthened community are under pressure. In education, workplaces, and government, efforts designed to foster belonging&mdash;mentorship programs, community-building initiatives, equitable STEM pathways&mdash;are being scaled back, renamed, or removed. In some states, new regulations seek to limit or eliminate programs that were created to help students feel seen and supported. Even some Girls Who Code programs may now face regulatory uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These changes reflect a broader pattern. When we reduce investment in connection&mdash;dismantling community programs, narrowing access, or reducing the structures that help people trust one another&mdash;the result is the same: more fragmentation, more doubt, and more people left to navigate challenges alone. Disconnection does not fuel progress. It only strengthens systems that benefit from keeping us apart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So where do we go from here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to redesign our systems for connection. That means treating emotional intelligence as expertise. Creating classrooms and workplaces that value collaboration as much as competition. Establishing real strategies for caring for people, teams, and ideas. Leading with empathy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it means asking a new question before we build anything, from a company to a curriculum to a piece of code: Does this strengthen our capacity to connect? If it does, keep going. If it doesn&rsquo;t, start over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Similar to how doctors take the Hippocratic Oath, &#8220;Do no harm,&#8221; technologists, engineers, and institutions need <a href=\"https://time.com/7312350/ai-engineers-need-hippocratic-oath/\" >their own version</a> to consider connection. Because today, harm shows up as isolated students, fractured communities, disengaged workers, and technologies that divide rather than unite.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we are serious about rebuilding connection, we must act with the same rigor we bring to any major innovation. That means making five commitments: Fund connection; design for belonging, not just efficiency; measure social cohesion as seriously as productivity; audit algorithms for their impact on trust; and teach collaboration as a core competency in STEM and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are not soft goals. They are choices and they are entirely within our power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we can engineer technologies that reshape the world, we can also engineer systems that strengthen the bonds between us. The future depends on us doing this work together.</p>\n",

In a Dec. 2 <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/america-250-presidential-message-on-the-anniversary-of-the-monroe-doctrine/\"  target=\"_blank\">message</a>, the President marked the anniversary of Monroe introducing the &ldquo;bold policy&rdquo; and stated that his Administration &ldquo;proudly reaffirms this promise under a new &lsquo;Trump Corollary&rsquo; to the Monroe Doctrine.&rdquo; Days later, the Administration released a controversial <a href=\"https://time.com/7339171/trump-national-security-strategy-europe/\" >national security strategy</a> that laid out that Trump Corollary in a section detailing its planned approach to the Western Hemisphere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what you should know about the history of the 1823 doctrine, and Trump&rsquo;s moves to revive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The history of the Monroe Doctrine</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Monroe introduced what would become known as the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/monroe-doctrine\"  target=\"_blank\">Monroe Doctrine</a> in his otherwise routine annual message to Congress on Dec. 2, 1823. In it, Monroe warned European powers against further colonization or interference in the Western Hemisphere, asserting that the region was no longer open to Old World ambitions and would be regarded as a sphere of U.S. interest. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The policy has since been invoked by a number of Administrations as justification for intervention in Latin America.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was first significantly put to the test in 1865, when the U.S. government helped then-Mexican President Benito Ju&aacute;rez overthrow Emperor Maximilian, who had been installed by the French government. Later in the 19th century, the U.S. stepped into Cuba&rsquo;s fight for independence against Spain and went to war with the European power in 1898, a conflict that effectively ended Spain&rsquo;s colonial presence in the region. The U.S., meanwhile, formally took control of Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines, and gained significant influence in Cuba&mdash;which U.S. leaders had long sought to purchase from Spain&mdash;via the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/platt-amendment\"  target=\"_blank\">Platt Agreement</a>, in the name of protecting the country&rsquo;s independence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Theodore Roosevelt, not long thereafter, introduced what would later be known as the <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/roosevelt-corollary\"  target=\"_blank\">Roosevelt Corollary</a> to the Monroe Doctrine after European creditors of a number of Latin American countries threatened to use armed intervention to collect debts. Roosevelt responded by asserting the U.S.&rsquo;s right to exercise &ldquo;international police power&rdquo; to curb what he deemed &ldquo;chronic wrongdoing&rdquo; in his 1904 message to Congress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://time.com/7343053/trump-goals-venezuela-dont-add-up/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Trump&rsquo;s Goals in Venezuela Don&rsquo;t Add Up</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the Monroe Doctrine&rsquo;s initial intent was to keep European powers out of the Western Hemisphere, Roosevelt, who himself fought against Spain in Cuba in 1898, in this way expanded it to encompass a claimed right to send troops into other Western Hemisphere countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This updated version of the doctrine helped set the stage for repeated U.S. military intervention in Latin America. Within just over a decade of Roosevelt articulating it, U.S. forces were sent to the Dominican Republic in 1903 and 1904, Nicaragua in 1911, and Haiti in 1915.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the wake of the World Wars, other presidents asserted their own doctrines that staked out a more interventionist U.S. position globally with the goal of, in <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/truman-doctrine\"  target=\"_blank\">President Harry Truman</a>&rsquo;s words, supporting &ldquo;free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation&rdquo; as the Cold War set in. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>That guiding foreign policy vision at times converged with the longstanding justification for action in the Western Hemisphere under the Monroe Doctrine, such as in the case of the U.S.&rsquo;s efforts to oust <a href=\"https://time.com/3666177/fidel-castro-cuba-history/\" >Fidel Castro</a>&rsquo;s communist government in Cuba and its role in the coups that overthrew Guatemalan President Jacobo &Aacute;rbenz in 1954 and Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973, both of whom U.S. leaders framed as communist threats in the region.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Eduardo Gamarra, a professor of politics and international relations at Florida International University, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/02/nx-s1-5652133/us-venezuela-interventionism-caribbean-latin-america-history-trump\"  target=\"_blank\">told</a> NPR that U.S. strategy in Latin America was one of strategic denial, aimed at deterring the involvement of non-American powers in affairs in the region. &ldquo;In the 1800s, that meant Europeans; in the 20th century, especially after World War II, it meant the Soviet Union,&rdquo; Gamarra said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><a href=\"https://time.com/7342994/trump-maduro-regime-change-maga/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>Donald Trump Is Risking His MAGA Base on Venezuela</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The spirit of the Monroe Doctrine was also reflected in the U.S.&rsquo;s actions during 1962&rsquo;s Cuban Missile Crisis, when President John F. Kennedy ordered a naval and air quarantine of Cuba to prevent the Soviet Union from bringing further missiles to the island. Kennedy framed the crisis, prompted by the U.S. discovering the Soviet Union was secretly installing missile launch sites in Cuba, as a violation of long-standing hemispheric boundaries.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By the time Trump launched his 2016 campaign, however, Obama Administration Secretary of State John Kerry had <a href=\"https://2009-2017.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2013/11/217680.htm\"  target=\"_blank\">declared</a> that &#8220;the era of the Monroe Doctrine is over.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The relationship that we seek and that we have worked hard to foster is not about a United States declaration about how and when it will intervene in the affairs of other American states,&rdquo; Kerry said in 2013. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about all of our countries viewing one another as equals, sharing responsibilities, cooperating on security issues, and adhering not to doctrine, but to the decisions that we make as partners to advance the values and the interests that we share.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Trump&rsquo;s reassertion of the doctrine</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the campaign trail and during his first Administration, Trump revived the &ldquo;America First&rdquo; slogan&mdash;previously used to promote nativist and isolationist policies by several groups and politicians in the 19th and 20th centuries&mdash;to frame his agenda, arguing that the United States should prioritize domestic priorities over overseas conflicts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That posture has shifted significantly in Trump&rsquo;s second term, however, as his Administration has taken a more interventionist approach to foreign policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even before returning to office, Trump began floating the idea of expanding U.S. territory by acquiring Greenland and the Panama Canal, and <a href=\"https://time.com/7205335/donald-trump-greenland-panama-justice-press-conference/\" >declined</a> to rule out using force to do so. In June, he directed U.S. strikes against three <a href=\"https://time.com/7296469/u-s-strikes-iran-nuclear-trump-war/\" >Iranian nuclear facilities</a>. And for months before Maduro&rsquo;s capture, his Administration exerted escalating pressure on the Venezuelan government, carrying out a series of deadly strikes against boats in the Caribbean Sea and eastern Pacific Ocean that it alleged were carrying drugs, amassing a substantial military presence in the region, imposing a <a href=\"https://time.com/7341303/trump-blockade-oil-tankers-venezuela/\" >blockade</a> on certain oil tankers going in and out of the country, and threatening further military action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <em><a href=\"https://time.com/7343093/trump-venezuela-us-next-colombia-cuba-greenland-iran-mexico/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trump&rsquo;s Potential Next Targets After Venezuela</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>These moves culminated in the high-profile operation in Caracas in which Maduro was seized. Following the Venezuelan leader&rsquo;s capture, Trump <a href=\"https://time.com/7343084/venezuela-trump-run-rubio-maduro-regime-change-oil-military-leader/\" >told</a> reporters, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper, and judicious transition&rdquo;&mdash;though Secretary of State Marco Rubio later <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-updates-01-04-2026\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> the U.S. would use economic leverage to influence the country&rsquo;s policy direction rather than governing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has also threatened <a href=\"https://time.com/7343093/trump-venezuela-us-next-colombia-cuba-greenland-iran-mexico/\" >further intervention</a> against a number of countries in recent days, reiterating his desire to <a href=\"https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/\" >annex Greenland</a>, suggesting he might pursue military action in Colombia and Mexico, and <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115824439366264186\"  target=\"_blank\">warning</a> that if Iran kills demonstrators amid the widespread protests in the country, &ldquo;America will come to their rescue.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump Administration has positioned this foreign policy agenda explicitly within the Monroe Doctrine framework.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Trump&rsquo;s message marking the doctrine&rsquo;s anniversary in December, he declared: &ldquo;The United States will never waver in defense of our homeland, our interests, or the well-being of our citizens. Today, my Administration proudly reaffirms this promise under a new &lsquo;Trump Corollary&rsquo; to the Monroe Doctrine: That the American people&mdash;not foreign nations nor globalist institutions&mdash;will always control their own destiny in our hemisphere.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The national security strategy released by the Administration late last year elaborates on this corollary, outlining plans to &ldquo;deny non-Hemispheric competitors the ability to position forces or other threatening capabilities, or to own or control strategically vital assets, in our Hemisphere.&rdquo;&nbsp; The strategy also signals a more interventionist and contentious approach to relations with the U.S.&rsquo;s European allies, levying sharp criticism against the continent&rsquo;s leaders and policies and&nbsp; calling for &ldquo;cultivating resistance to Europe&rsquo;s current trajectory within European nations.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><em><a href=\"https://time.com/7339171/trump-national-security-strategy-europe/\" >Trump&rsquo;s National Security Strategy Sparks European Backlash Over &lsquo;Far-Right&rsquo; Rhetoric. Here&rsquo;s What It Says</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Administration has cast Trump&rsquo;s threats and military actions as means of both protecting the U.S. and serving its economic interests. In regard to Venezuela, for instance, it has justified its strikes on alleged drug boats and moves against the country as part of an effort to combat cartels trafficking drugs into the U.S. Following Maduro&rsquo;s capture, Trump has also referenced Venezuela&rsquo;s oil reserves and suggested that his Administration could subsidize U.S. oil companies moving into the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his push to annex Greenland, he has also said the territory is essential for both the U.S.&rsquo;s &ldquo;national security&rdquo; and &ldquo;economic security.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Bolton, Trump&rsquo;s former security adviser, cautioned that there is no consistent framework guiding the approach, however.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;There is no Trump Doctrine: No matter what he does, there is no grand conceptual framework; it&rsquo;s whatever suits him at the moment,&rdquo; Bolton <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-monroe-doctrine-venezuela/685502/\"  target=\"_blank\">told</a> <em>The Atlantic</em>.&nbsp;</p>\n",

This image moved quickly across global media and was shared, <a href=\"https://www.nike.com/t/tech-mens-fleece-windrunner-full-zip-jacket-HqUykgjE/HV0949-063?nikemt=true&amp;cp=72926007032_search_--g-21728772664-191552983329--c-1015649736-00197602907155&amp;dplnk=member&amp;gclsrc=aw.ds&amp;gad_source=1&amp;gad_campaignid=21728772664&amp;gbraid=0AAAAADy86kMVq1f2X6FUDgjgpBEQU-hY2&amp;gclid=Cj0KCQiAgvPKBhCxARIsAOlK_Eq9_nmyDCD6pBXzVriG9KnZj3556u17M1eSqjOuMJ7sC6UdmUJ89hcaAudnEALw_wcB\"  target=\"_blank\">commented on</a>, memed, and folded into the <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3338837/comfortable-long-flights-maduros-nike-tracksuit-selling-out-after-trump-post?module=perpetual_scroll_0&amp;pgtype=article\"  target=\"_blank\">familiar rhythms of contemporary visual culture</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n<p>What drew immediate attention was not only the informality of Maduro&rsquo;s clothing, but the presence of a globally recognizable brand in a moment typically governed by the visual codes of state power. Athleisure replaced uniform; a logo supplanted insignia. Interpretation was structured less by the language of politics than by that of the marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The image mattered not because it diminished power, but because it reframed it. A moment of political consequence was filtered through the visual language of branding&mdash;familiar, legible, and emotionally neutral&mdash;reshaping how the event was absorbed and understood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an era when logos often outlast leaders, this reframing feels less anomalous than revealing. The Nike swoosh did not register as a crisis for the brand, nor did it meaningfully erode the gravity of the moment itself. Instead, it redirected attention. A symbol designed for recognition took precedence over institutional markers of authority, subtly reorganizing the viewer&rsquo;s response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Power has always relied on visual form to make itself legible. For centuries, authority announced itself through uniforms, architecture, ceremony, and controlled display&mdash;systems designed to signal hierarchy, distance, and consequence. Leaders were styled to appear elevated and distinct from ordinary life. Even moments of capture or downfall adhered to this grammar, carefully staged to communicate rupture and finality. Clothing, in this context, functioned as a marker of power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contemporary visual culture organizes meaning differently. Today, the most widely circulated symbols are not those of the state, but those of the marketplace. Brands cross borders more freely than political iconography, and arrive with preloaded emotional associations. A recognizable logo requires no explanation; it is instantly understood. Its familiarity feels neutral, even when it quietly shapes interpretation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What the photographs of Maduro suggest is not the disappearance of power&rsquo;s visual language, but its entanglement with symbols that operate as cultural shorthand. A useful contrast can be found in the <a href=\"https://content.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,20031222,00.html\" >images released</a> after the <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/independentpremium/capture-sadam-hussein-2003-iraq-b2072901.html\"  target=\"_blank\">capture of Saddam Hussein in 2003</a>. Those photographs were engineered to communicate rupture and subjugation: disheveled hair, a visibly diminished body, the unmistakable signs of force. The message was explicit. Power had been stripped away, and the image insisted upon that assessment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The photographs of Maduro operate differently. The Nike logo carries a distinct and widely shared set of meanings, often associated with athletes, celebrities, and leisure. It functions not as a marker of authority, but as a mechanism of alignment. When placed on a figure historically defined by control and spectacle, it collapses the distance that authoritarian imagery depends upon. Power does not disappear in this image; it is recontextualized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aside from the handcuffs, little in the frame signals coercion or loss of control. Dressed in athleisure, Maduro appears composed, almost casual&mdash;closer to a figure en route to a tennis match than one forcibly removed from power. Where the image of Hussein communicated consequence through visual degradation, the image of Maduro diffuses consequence through familiarity, structuring interpretation not through rupture, but through normalization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The response to the photographs of Maduro has not inspired outrage or catharsis; instead, it has generated commentary, irony, and consumption. Searches for &ldquo;Nike Tech&rdquo; on Google spiked, and the tracksuit <a href=\"https://www.euronews.com/culture/2026/01/06/just-coup-it-nicolas-maduros-nike-sweatsuit-becomes-unexpected-viral-sensation\"  target=\"_blank\">sold out in multiple sizes</a>. The moment was processed less as a reckoning than as a cultural artifact&mdash;circulated, annotated, and absorbed into the endless scroll of &ldquo;content.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is not a failure of seriousness so much as a shift in how seriousness is encountered. In a media environment dominated by speed and repetition, images are now interpreted through existing symbolic frameworks before political meaning has time to settle. Brands, by virtue of their ubiquity, have become some of the most powerful of these frameworks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this sense, branding now functions as a kind of visual infrastructure. It does not declare authority, but it organizes attention. It offers interpretive cues that feel neutral precisely because they are familiar. Political imagery, once governed by ritual and formality, has become increasingly mediated through symbols designed not for judgment, but for recognition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This creates a paradox. Brands have been historically understood as apolitical, yet they now carry a disproportionate share of cultural meaning. Their power lies not in persuasion, but in legibility. Governments change. Leaders fall. Logos and brands persist, shaping perception as events move past&mdash;or with&mdash;them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The risk here is not that branding overtakes politics, but that it alters how political consequence is felt. When moments of accountability are visually translated into the language of lifestyle, the emotional register shifts. What should feel destabilizing is rendered manageable, familiar, and easily consumed&mdash;becoming fodder for late night television rather than collective reckoning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The image of Nicol&aacute;s Maduro in Nike athleisure did not trivialize power; it normalized it. And normalization, in this context, may be more corrosive than spectacle. The visual cues did not instruct viewers how to judge the event&mdash;they simply made it easier to absorb.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps the most unsettling aspect of the images of Maduro&rsquo;s capture is not that power appeared diminished, but that it appeared ordinary. And in a culture where the ordinary is endlessly scrollable, is our scrolling the final transformation of power itself?</p>\n",

I was in preschool, receiving adaptive physical education for the first time in East Los Angeles with my very own, one-on-one P.E teacher. He was teaching me how to walk, sternly saying &ldquo;heel-toe, heel-toe&rdquo; and applying pressure on the corresponding body parts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was frustrated and confused. I knew what my heel was, I knew what my toe was. Why wasn&rsquo;t anything working? Why was this man touching me, and why was he so annoyed? Didn&rsquo;t he understand how hard this was for me?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That day marked the beginning of my awareness that something was &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; with me, that needed to be corrected. I later learned that what I struggled with had a name: cerebral palsy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Without that overworked P.E. teacher, whom I loathed seeing each session, I would not be able to walk properly today. Without the therapists who came after him, I would never have learned how to throw and catch a ball, how to skip, how to run in a straight line, and, most importantly, I wouldn&rsquo;t have learned how to fall and get back up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-4_Mejicanos-1.jpg\" alt=\"Mejicanos receives at-home physical therapy in 2004 with her physical therapist propping her up.\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>These adaptive P.E. teachers and other occupational therapists, however imperfect, were a lifeline.

The Trump administration is working to dismantle the Department of Education and move IDEA to the Department of Health and Human Services, which <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/about-nea/media-center/press-releases/nea-idea-50-years-old-and-risk\"  target=\"_blank\">lacks experience</a> protecting the civil rights of students with disabilities. President Trump&rsquo;s actions have already led to a nationwide collapse in resolutions for disability rights cases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to reporting by NPR last month, the U.S. Education Department&rsquo;s Office for Civil Rights (OCR), which handles cases of discrimination against disabled students, has only resolved 73 cases involving alleged <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/03/nx-s1-5591152/trump-special-education-disabilties-schools\"  target=\"_blank\">disability discrimination this year</a>. In 2024, OCR resolved 390 cases. And in 2017, the year Trump took office his first term, OCR reached agreements in <a href=\"https://ocrcas.ed.gov/ocr-search?ADA-504=528&amp;sort_order=ASC&amp;sort_by=field_resolved&amp;f%5B0%5D=ocr_statutes%3A528&amp;f%5B1%5D=resolved%3A2017\"  target=\"_blank\">more than 1,000</a> cases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is this happening? During the government shutdown, President Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/10/13/nx-s1-5572489/trump-special-education-department-funding-layoffs-disabilities\"  target=\"_blank\">gutted the office</a> responsible for implementing IDEA. And although the deal to re-open the federal government required the reinstatement of fired workers, that provision expires after January 30. Consequently, the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services is in turmoil. NPR described the office as the <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/11/13/nx-s1-5608038/shutdown-special-education-department-layoffs\"  target=\"_blank\">&ldquo;central nervous system&rdquo;</a> for programs that support students with disabilities. The office is also responsible for ensuring that states are complying with IDEA, and distributes roughly $15 billion in funds for its programs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image-2_Mejicanos.png\" alt=\"Victoria Mejicanos in 2008 in Kindergarten practicing her writing skills. Her occupational therapists helped her practice tasks like holding a pencil and spelling her name.\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>So, what happens to the <a href=\"https://nces.ed.gov/programs/coe/indicator/cgg/students-with-disabilities\"  target=\"_blank\">7.5 million students, or 15 percent of all public students nationwide</a>, who rely on this office to ensure their rights are upheld? If the office loses its staff next year, the effects would be far-reaching. According to the Department of Education, prior to this landmark legislation in 1975, children like me were <a href=\"https://sites.ed.gov/idea/IDEA-History\"  target=\"_blank\">denied access to education</a>. Many states also had laws excluding students who were deaf, blind, emotionally disturbed, or had an intellectual disability. In extreme cases, children were <a href=\"https://undivided.io/resources/background-and-history-of-idea-in-special-education-116\"  target=\"_blank\">institutionalized</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it hadn&rsquo;t been for individualized education programs tied to IDEA, my oldest brother, who is severely mentally impaired, would never have known the thrill of a high school football game. My second youngest brother, who has autism, would never have learned to talk. I may have been confined to a wheelchair and sent to a special school. An IEP gives students with disabilities specific and measurable goals, and support to work toward them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the 50-year anniversary of the IDEA legislation&rsquo;s passage this month, I pulled out a bright pink accordion file folder from my closet labeled &ldquo;Victoria&rsquo;s IEP&rsquo;s 2005-2014.&rdquo; My mother had diligently kept a hard copy of every single IEP I ever had, and gave me the folder when I turned 18. I generally avoided this folder, not seeing any point in examining my past because I knew it would hurt. But after realizing that these programs could be in jeopardy, I delved into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Image3_Mejicanos.png\" alt=\"Victoria Mejicanos in 2007 practicing riding a tricycle, which was part of her IEP goals.\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In my first IEP, I had five pages worth of goals written and agreed upon by my IEP team: a special education teacher, an adaptive P.E. teacher, and my parents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I read my first IEP from Dec. 13, 2006, I felt an overwhelming flood of memories and emotions reading one of my goals: &ldquo;To demonstrate improved walking balance, Victoria will be able to walk over 4-6 inch raised surfaces without falling or losing her balance four out of five times.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can see the rainbow stairs laid out in front of me in the school cafeteria. They&rsquo;re each a different color. I always felt confident after I took that first step. I remember it because it was red. Then came orange, which was higher up. Then, yellow, and boom&mdash;I was stuck. I needed help, and I hated having to wait for it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It took me what felt like an eternity to finally make it over the rainbow stairs without help. It was a goal I struggled with until second grade. I used to go home after school, and practice going up and down my grandmother&rsquo;s stairs or even the small set of stairs in the school cafeteria before my after-school program until I couldn&rsquo;t feel my legs. I eventually met that goal, and many others set for me.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I stopped receiving special education services at 11 years old. Recently, as I carefully read and sifted through years of goals and objectives, I began to wonder who I would be and what I would think of myself had I never achieved these milestones, or had they never existed to begin with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I worry, thinking about children just like me who know they are disabled, but also know they are more than that. I couldn&rsquo;t walk upstairs or jump properly, but I loved to play teacher, read, and write, which I am pursuing as a career. My dreams back then, like the dreams of all children, transcended the limits of reality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of the uncertainty around the implementation of IDEA, it&rsquo;s crucial for states to be proactive in providing support for individualized education programs. California Gov. Gavin Newsom recently signed legislation to <a href=\"https://a30.asmdc.org/press-releases/20251010-addis-special-education-bill-signed-governor-newsom\"  target=\"_blank\">strengthen support</a> for special education teachers. Assembly Bill 560 directs the state to develop recommended staffing ratios for special-education classrooms by 2027 and to distribute special-education assessments more equitably among teachers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are positive steps, but they&rsquo;re insufficient. Children with disabilities deserve more than incremental fixes. Some states offer models worth noting: New Jersey, for example, <a href=\"https://www.kaltmanlaw.com/post/best-states-for-special-education-2?utm_source=chatgpt.com\"  target=\"_blank\">spends the most</a> on school support services. Massachusetts similarly invests heavily in early intervention programs and therapies that help children with disabilities participate fully in school and community life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other state leaders must support disabled students, regardless of whether or not there is a federal arm forcing them to. Already, the success of IDEA has come despite Congress funding less than 12 percent of its costs&mdash;far short of the 40 percent <a href=\"https://www.nea.org/resource-library/individual-disabilities-education-act-idea-funding-gaps-school-district\"  target=\"_blank\">originally pledged.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Local districts bear too much of the financial and administrative burden, leaving students at the mercy of local budgets and priorities. States can fix this by fully funding high-cost services, enforcing minimum staffing standards, and linking funds to compliance and outcomes&mdash;ensuring every child gets the support they deserve, no matter where they live. Education is not a privilege, but a right.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am a product of IDEA. I am a woman with cerebral palsy, and I live a full and happy life. Other children deserve the same future as me; they deserve to make it over the rainbow, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This essay was originally developed in &lsquo;Our Unsilencing,&rsquo; a commentary bootcamp at the USC Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism in partnership with Unseen</em>.</p>\n",

For the first time, TIME and data firm <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/\"  target=\"_blank\">Statista</a> have created a rigorous methodology with which to measure the world&rsquo;s most sustainable companies for 2024. The companies at the top of the list have signed on to some of the most respected climate programs, including the 1.5&deg;C target from the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), and receive high scores from CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project). TIME and Statista further held companies to high standards for their Scope 1 and 2 emissions and energy consumption relative to company size, emissions reductions in 2021 and 2022 (the most recent years fully reported), and proportion of renewable energy used by the company&rsquo;s operations. (Scope 1 emissions are directly caused by a company; Scope 2 are indirectly created when a company purchases power.) And, perhaps most importantly, many of the top companies have incorporated sustainability into their business models. </p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Schneider Electric, for instance, which is based in France and tops the list, creates software and services for energy management. It has not only set ambitious targets to reduce its own emissions&mdash;carbon neutral by 2025&mdash;but also helps its customers reduce emissions and become more energy efficient through its Sustainability Business. It has its own sustainability impact program to track its performance, and has also reduced emissions across its supply chain. Schneider has received a climate score of &ldquo;A&rdquo; from the CDP for 12 years in a row. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve positioned the company to be an impact company,&rdquo; CEO Peter W. Herweck said on a recent earnings call.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While many companies that ranked highly are in industries that don&rsquo;t make many physical products&mdash;like banking, tech, and consulting&mdash;there were companies that showed sustainability is possible even if you make things. Illumina, the U.S. biotechnology company that&#8217;s fifth on the list, recently debuted its most powerful gene sequencer while also reducing packaging waste by 90% from the previous model. Moncler, the Italian luxury fashion house, ranked third on the list by using recycled materials, recycling more than 80% of its nylon scraps in 2023, and using 100% renewable energy at its directly managed offices, stores, factories, and logistics hubs. &ldquo;While we take pride in this achievement, we are aware much remains to be done,&rdquo; said Remo Ruffini, chairman and CEO of Moncler S.p.A, when the company was named to the Dow Jones Sustainability Indices in 2023. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While impressive, Schneider&rsquo;s top score of 88.86 out of 100 on TIME&rsquo;s list shows the distance even the most dedicated companies have to go to be truly sustainable.

But after the <a href=\"https://time.com/7343084/venezuela-trump-run-rubio-maduro-regime-change-oil-military-leader/\" >U.S. raided Venezuela</a> over the weekend, Trump&rsquo;s arctic bluster appears more serious than ever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A day after the <a href=\"https://time.com/7342864/venezuela-caracas-strikes-trump/\" >attack on Venezuela</a>, which killed dozens of people and <a href=\"https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/\" >deposed its leader Nicol&aacute;s Maduro</a>, Katie Miller, the wife of White House deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, <a href=\"https://x.com/KatieMiller/status/2007541679293944266\"  target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on X a map of Greenland with the American flag superimposed on it. &ldquo;SOON,&rdquo; she wrote in the caption.

But the Trump Administration has <a href=\"https://time.com/7208293/buying-greenland-history/\" >coveted</a> even more authority over the territory for its strategic location in the Arctic region to protect U.S. and NATO security interests. &ldquo;We do need Greenland, absolutely. We need it for defense,&rdquo; Trump told <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-venezuela-maduro-delcy-rodriguez/685497/\"  target=\"_blank\"><em>the Atlantic</em></a> on Sunday, noting that the island is &ldquo;surrounded by Russian and Chinese ships.&rdquo; Greenland also happens to be <a href=\"https://time.com/7271481/climate-change-greenland-trump/\" >rich in natural resources</a> including natural gas, oil, and minerals that are used in technology and military applications, which have been at the center of a <a href=\"https://time.com/7325306/us-china-trump-xi-trade-tensions-truce-export-controls-tariffs/\" >trade war between the U.S. and China</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump Administration, however, has been met with decisive opposition from the leaders of other NATO countries, including Denmark, which still controls Greenland&rsquo;s defence and foreign policy. The leaders of Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, and the U.K. said in a <a href=\"https://www.elysee.fr/en/emmanuel-macron/2026/01/06/joint-statement-on-greenland\"  target=\"_blank\">Jan. 6 joint statement</a> that &ldquo;It is for Denmark and Greenland, and them only, to decide on matters concerning Denmark and Greenland.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;NATO has made clear that the Arctic region is a priority and &zwj;European Allies are stepping up,&rdquo; the statement said. &ldquo;We and many other Allies have increased our presence, activities and investments to keep the Arctic safe and to deter adversaries.&rdquo; Over the past year, Trump has leveraged trade with the U.S. to push allies to invest more in security and defence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among Greenlanders, there is a <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/polls-open-in-greenlands-parliamentary-elections-as-independence-looms-large\"  target=\"_blank\">desire for independence</a> from Denmark, but the Trump Administration has also sought in recent months to foment <a href=\"https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-push-for-greenland-shakes-up-arctic-island-s-politics/7955482.html\"  target=\"_blank\">support for the U.S.</a> within the territory&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/01/10/nuuk-greenland-trump-denmark-00197070\"  target=\"_blank\">pro-independence movement</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Enough is enough,&rdquo; Greenland&rsquo;s Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen <a href=\"https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/\" >said</a> on Monday. &ldquo;No more pressure. No more innuendo. No more fantasies about annexation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, a U.S. official told <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/trump-advisers-discussing-options-acquiring-greenland-us-military-is-always-an-2026-01-06/\"  target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a> that Trump&rsquo;s desire for Greenland is &ldquo;not going away&rdquo; because of such objections. Instead, the Trump Administration is considering a range of options to secure control of the island in the wake of its military operation in Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Diplomacy is always the president&rsquo;s first option &zwnj;with anything, and deal making. He loves deals. So if a good deal can be struck to acquire Greenland, that would definitely be his first instinct,&rdquo; the official said, specifying the possibility of a Compact of Free Association agreement or a U.S. purchase of the territory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Trump himself has also not shied away from the possibility of military action, even as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/live/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-updates-01-06-2026#0000019b-95df-deb2-a9bf-f7df5f300000\"  target=\"_blank\">some political allies appear more reluctant for now</a>. In March, the President <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/trump-us-control-greenland/story?id=120208823\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> the U.S. would &ldquo;go as far as we have to go&rdquo; in order to take control of Greenland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here&rsquo;s what to know about the ways the Trump Administration could take control of Greenland.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Tapping on pro-independence movement</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During Trump&rsquo;s second term, his Administration has sought to exploit the pro-independence movement in Greenland to stoke pro-American sentiments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vice President J.D. Vance visited Greenland in March and called for the territory&rsquo;s independence from Denmark. &ldquo;The people of Greenland are going to have self-determination,&rdquo; Vance <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3y3vdvdggo\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a>, suggesting that the U.S. planned to deal with Greenland independently. &ldquo;We hope that they choose to partner with the United States, because we&rsquo;re the only nation on Earth that will respect their sovereignty and respect their security.&rdquo; Greenland currently needs Denmark&rsquo;s approval to sign deals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Last month, Trump appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry, a Republican, as special envoy to Greenland&mdash;a role created by Trump that signals the U.S.&rsquo;s intention to treat Greenland as separate from Denmark. Landry &ldquo;understands how essential Greenland is to our National Security,&rdquo; Trump <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115760829286615399\"  target=\"_blank\">posted</a> on Truth Social in December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked by <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/01/06/la-gov-landry-pres-trump-supports-an-independent-greenland-with-economic-ties-to-the-u-s.html\"  target=\"_blank\">CNBC</a> whether Arctic security should be decided in conjunction with NATO, Landry argued on the basis of self-determination and anti-imperialism to support greater U.S. influence over Greenland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think we should ask the Greenlanders,&rdquo; Landry said, pointing to the <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1801-1829/monroe\"  target=\"_blank\">Monroe Doctrine</a>, a foreign policy declared in 1823 that asserted that the Americas should not be subject to future colonization by European powers while the U.S. would not interfere in European affairs. The U.S. has since cited the doctrine to justify American intervention in Latin American countries, including the <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/how-the-monroe-doctrine-factors-into-the-u-s-arrest-of-venezuelas-maduro\"  target=\"_blank\">recent Venezuela intervention</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. government has also been <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/greenland-spying-us-intelligence-809c4ef2?mod=hp_lead_pos3\"  target=\"_blank\">accused of spying on and seeking to covertly influence</a> Greenland&rsquo;s pro-independence movement. Denmark <a href=\"https://time.com/7312624/greenland-covert-operation-trump-denmark/\" >summoned</a> U.S. diplomats last year over reported covert influence operations in Greenland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In public opinion polls, a majority of Greenlanders said they would vote in favor of independence from Denmark if given a plebiscite. Greenland would also require the approval of a deal between its government and Denmark&rsquo;s in order to gain independence. But <a href=\"https://www.veriangroup.com/news-and-insights/opinion-poll-greenland-2025\"  target=\"_blank\">85% of Greenlanders</a> polled last year also said they were against Greenland leaving Denmark only to become part of the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Cutting a deal</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another option reportedly on the table is purchasing the territory. Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers at a closed briefing that the Administration wants to buy Greenland from Denmark, according to the <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/politics/national-security/rubio-tells-lawmakers-trump-aims-to-buy-greenland-downplays-military-action-5c94e05c\"  target=\"_blank\"><em>Wall Street Journal</em></a>. The White House&rsquo;s threats against Greenland are as such part of a negotiating tactic, not a sign of imminent invasion, Rubio said. Greenland and Denmark have said that they want to meet with Rubio to clarify the U.S.&rsquo;s claims over Greenland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>American officials have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/may/09/us-greenland-trump\"  target=\"_blank\">reportedly</a> also floated the idea of a Compact of Free Association&mdash;an agreement that would allow U.S. armed forces to operate without restriction in the territory in exchange for the U.S. providing protection, certain services, and duty-free trade. The U.S. currently has COFA agreements with Micronesia, the Marshall Islands, and Palau. But such an agreement would likely require Greenland to first be independent of Denmark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I think that the President supports an independent Greenland with economic ties and trade opportunities for the United States,&rdquo; Landry told CNBC, adding that the U.S. could offer a better economic deal to Greenland than Denmark or Europe do.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Military action &lsquo;always an option&rsquo;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If all else fails, however, the White House told media outlets on Tuesday that &ldquo;utilizing the U.S. military is always an option at the Commander-in-Chief&rsquo;s disposal.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&rsquo;s not the first time the Trump Administration has raised military force as a possibility. Last June, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/hegseth-greenland-invasion-contingency-plans/\"  target=\"_blank\">testified</a> at a congressional hearing that the Pentagon has &ldquo;plans for any contingency&rdquo; when it comes to taking Greenland (or Panama) by force if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Invading Greenland would be an extreme measure&mdash;doing so would go against American and international law. Already, Sen. Ruben Gallego (D, Ariz.) <a href=\"https://x.com/RubenGallego/status/2008584868368621888\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> he will introduce a resolution to block Trump from invading Greenland. Committing U.S. troops to armed conflict, including a military occupation, for longer than 60 days would require congressional approval. And even Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, a frequent Trump defender, told reporters Tuesday that he didn&rsquo;t believe seizing Greenland by force would be &ldquo;appropriate.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the Trump Administration has already ignored lawmakers&rsquo; protests of its ongoing military aggression against Venezuela and carried out lethal strikes on boats in the Caribbean and the Pacific with <a href=\"https://time.com/7317506/us-venezuela-war-powers-international-law-trump-maduro-drugs-cartel-boat-strike/\" >questionable legal basis</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Certainly, an invasion of Greenland would risk the NATO alliance and the U.S.&rsquo;s relationship with its allies. But should Trump decide getting Greenland is worth the risk, there may not be much in his way. NATO cannot respond militarily without unanimous approval, which includes that of the U.S., and while theoretically European countries could try to defend Greenland, the U.S. military is vastly larger and better equipped, and already has troops stationed in Greenland.&ldquo;The United States military is capable of landing any number of forces on Greenland, either by air or by sea, and then claiming that it&rsquo;s American territory,&rdquo; Thomas Crosbie, an associate professor of military operations at the Royal Danish Defense College, told <a href=\"https://www.politico.eu/article/donald-trump-greenland-easy-steps-nato-policy-deal-military/\"  target=\"_blank\"><em>Politico</em></a>. Lin Mortensgaard, a researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies, added that such an operation would be over &ldquo;in half an hour or less.&rdquo;</p>\n",

The three-part Investigation Discovery docuseries, available on HBO Max beginning Jan. 6, reexamines the story through court records and medical history, while placing particular emphasis on the belief system the Yates family subscribed to leading up to the tragedy.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>The series includes the participation of Rusty Yates, Andrea&rsquo;s former husband, as well as former followers of preacher Michael Woroniecki. They describe a set of teachings informed by rigid doctrine, fear, and isolation, which they claim might have intensified Andrea&rsquo;s mental illness long before the crime occurred. Filmmakers attempted to reach Woroniecki, who <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=126222&amp;page=1\"  target=\"_blank\">has said that he is not to blame</a> for Yates&rsquo; actions, and his wife Rachel Woroniecki, neither of whom responded to requests for participation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The crime that shocked the world</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On June 20, 2001, in the Houston suburb of Clear Lake, Andrea Yates <a href=\"https://time.com/4476684/andrea-yates-grieves-children-drown/\" >drowned her five children</a>&mdash;Noah, John, Paul, Luke, and Mary&mdash;in the family bathtub. The children ranged in age from six months to seven years. After the killings, Andrea called 911 and confessed. When police arrived, she answered the door with wet hair and clothing and calmly told officers, &ldquo;I killed my kids<em>.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Inside the home, one child was found in the bathtub, while the others were laid out under a sheet in the master bedroom. Investigators found no signs of struggle and determined that Andrea acted alone during the short period between her husband leaving for work and the planned arrival of her mother-in-law. Andrea Yates was immediately taken into custody following the discovery.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A life defined by discipline and achievement</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/YEWF101_CBTK_ARC1458_M_Photo_RYates_1993_Andrea_03_Favorite.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Yates wedding\" alignment=\"original-size-image\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea Yates, born Andrea Kennedy on July 2, 1964, in Houston, Texas, was the youngest of five siblings in what Rusty described as a stable household. She performed well academically, graduating as valedictorian before earning a nursing degree in 1986. She worked for several years as a registered nurse at a cancer treatment center, building a career rooted in structure and responsibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea met Russell &ldquo;Rusty&rdquo; Yates in 1989. The couple married in 1993, and Andrea soon left her profession to devote herself fully to family life, motherhood, and the religious practice that had become more central to her life since meeting Rusty. Between 1994 and 2000, they had five children.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The preacher and the doctrine</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Rusty Yates was a follower of Woroniecki, who regularly traveled to college campuses and large events to spread his teachings, which would profoundly shape the Yates family&rsquo;s worldview. Former followers of Woroniecki who are interviewed in the docuseries and refer to themselves as &ldquo;survivors&rdquo; allege that Woroniecki exerted control through sermons, handwritten letters, and cassette tapes sent by mail, presenting himself as a spiritual authority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Moses Storm, one such former follower who is featured in the docuseries, says that media coverage often overlooks a crucial element. &ldquo;When I watch news coverage and documentaries about Andrea Yates, it doesn&rsquo;t do it for me. They are missing a huge part of the story: Michael Woroniecki.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the docuseries, he describes Woroniecki as his family&rsquo;s spiritual teacher and a major influence on both his family and the Yates family. &ldquo;A huge part of his teachings was the impending doom of judgment day. God was going to end the world in a matter of 46 minutes right now. It was that intense.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Storm says fear permeated daily life. &ldquo;He said there would be a thunderstorm that would prompt my mom to get on her knees and pray, &lsquo;God please save us, save our kids.&#8217; It gave me nightmares. My older sister would have these visions and she would start hitting her body just to stop.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rusty Yates confirmed that he and Andrea were in regular contact with Woroniecki, who mailed cassette tapes to the couple. Storm adds, &ldquo;My siblings and I, we were born into it. And unless you&rsquo;re in it, you don&rsquo;t fully understand the amount of control that Michael Woroniecki had over us.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Recruitment and isolation</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another person interviewed in the docuseries, David De La Isla, describes meeting Woroniecki on his college campus, where the preacher held a large banner reading, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to hell.&rdquo; Drawn in by his message of salvation, David reached out. He now calls this &ldquo;the biggest mistake of my life.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In response, Woroniecki sent letters and cassette tapes, referring to himself as an &ldquo;Ambassador of Christ.&rdquo; David recalled the impact of those teachings: &ldquo;I was studying, evaluating Michael&rsquo;s teaching. He said that every institution&mdash;college and hospital&mdash; they&rsquo;re all satanic distractions. So you do everything except seek the real God. I thought the whole world was controlled by the devil.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Storm adds that Woroniecki discouraged formal education, insisting children be homeschooled to avoid &ldquo;satanic&rdquo; influence. He recalled being indoctrinated at a very young age. &ldquo;As early as three years old, I was out on the street yelling at people saying you&rsquo;re headed for hell, even though I had no idea what I was saying<em>.</em>&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Mental illness and missed warnings</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/YEWF103_20240910_RustyEncounter1.jpg\" alt=\"Rusty Yates IV\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea&rsquo;s mental health began to severely deteriorate after the birth of her children. In 1999, following the birth of Luke, Rusty recalled a disturbing incident. &ldquo;We were still at Andrea&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s house and Andrea walked off. I open the bathroom door and she is standing, looking at herself in the mirror, with a knife up to her neck. She just stood there, catatonic.&rdquo; Though Andrea didn&rsquo;t harm herself in that instance, she was hospitalized and diagnosed with <a href=\"https://time.com/4377455/postpartum-depression-postpartum-psychosis-symptoms/\" >postpartum depression</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea initially improved with treatment, but by the end of 1999, she had stopped taking her medication. Despite medical concerns, the couple had a fifth child, Mary, in November 2000.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the months that followed, Andrea&rsquo;s condition worsened. She experienced hallucinations and believed the devil was inside her. During this period, Andrea received a letter from Rachel Woroniecki, Michael&rsquo;s wife, reinforcing those fears. The letter, shown in <em>Cult Behind the Killer</em>, read:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I pray for you Andrea. For you, Rusty and your family. I know things are not the way you would like to be. I&rsquo;ve seen many women just continually put off their salvation in Jesus. Jesus knows how weak you are, how weak and vulnerable. I know you&rsquo;re frustrated, Andrea. You&rsquo;re accountable for these children. You can change them. There would be a day when it&rsquo;s too late. Don&rsquo;t look to Rusty, look to Jesus. If you allow Satan to come in and still be understanding, the consequences will be tragic. Love and Jesus, Rachel.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The teachings Andrea internalized</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea had written to Rachel in 1999 announcing Luke&rsquo;s birth. The docuseries states that Rachel&rsquo;s response echoed teachings later found in Michael Woroniecki&rsquo;s publication &ldquo;Perilous Times,&rdquo; which claimed that &ldquo;unrighteous mothers&rdquo; produced &ldquo;unrighteous children&rdquo; who would burn in hell unless they died.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the documentary, De La Isla says that &ldquo;Rusty came across the survivors&rsquo; website&rdquo; about Michael Woroniecki, which was active at the time. According to De La Isla, Rusty later sent him the cassette tapes that Woroniecki had previously sent to Andrea Yates. De La Isla says Andrea listened to the recordings repeatedly, including on the morning of the tragedy. The recording, played in the doc, states: &ldquo;If you want to submit to His Kingdom, then you must conform. You must go with His program. You must yield. You can&rsquo;t just do your own little thing or you will pay consequences.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yates&#8217; <strong>trials</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/YEWF103_AndreaArrested.jpeg\" alt=\"Andrea Yates arrested\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea Yates was charged with five counts of capital murder and went to trial in 2002. Prosecutors argued that, despite her documented mental illness, she understood that her actions were legally wrong. As part of that argument, they emphasized that Andrea waited until she was alone with the children before committing the killings and then contacted authorities afterward, which they claimed demonstrated awareness and intent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The defense maintained that Andrea was not guilty by reason of insanity, presenting extensive medical records and psychiatric testimony documenting severe postpartum psychosis. According to the defense, Andrea was suffering from persistent delusions and believed that killing her children was the only way to save them from eternal damnation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rusty Yates supported the defense throughout the trial, repeatedly stating that Andrea&rsquo;s actions were the result of untreated mental illness rather than criminal intent. Despite the evidence presented, the jury rejected the insanity defense. Andrea Yates was convicted and sentenced to life in prison, with eligibility for parole after 40 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2005, Yates&rsquo; conviction was overturned by the Texas Court of Appeals. The reversal centered on <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/11/court.archive.yates2/index.html\"  target=\"_blank\">false testimony</a> given by prosecution expert Dr. Park Dietz, who claimed during the trial that an episode of <em>Law &amp; Order</em> had aired depicting a woman who drowned her children and was found not guilty by reason of insanity. The prosecution used this claim to suggest Andrea may have fabricated her defense after watching the episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was later confirmed that no such episode existed, and Dietz chalked the error up to his own incorrect recollection. The appellate court ruled that the inaccurate testimony was materially misleading and could have influenced the jury&rsquo;s decision, violating Andrea Yates&rsquo; right to a fair trial.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Michael Woroniecki&rsquo;s connection to Yates and current work</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>During Andrea Yates&rsquo; trial, some of Michael Woroniecki&rsquo;s materials were introduced as evidence. Prosecutors suggested that his religious messaging may have influenced Yates&rsquo; mental state, but no legal responsibility was assigned to him in connection with the deaths of Andrea Yates&rsquo; five children, nor was his religious group formally classified as a cult. While the documentary and media coverage describe his teachings as &ldquo;cult-like,&rdquo; this reflects interpretation rather than a legal finding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woroniecki has said that he did not influence Andrea Yates&rsquo; actions. In an <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=126222&amp;page=1\"  target=\"_blank\">interview with ABC&#8239;News </a>in 2002, he stated that he &ldquo;shared Jesus with them&rdquo; and warned Rusty Yates repeatedly about the children&rsquo;s spiritual needs. He added, &ldquo;Everybody is going to hell,&rdquo; clarifying that his message about Satan and hell was intended as religious guidance, not to push anyone toward harmful behavior. He described claims that his preaching caused the tragedy as &ldquo;ridiculous.&rdquo; Woroniecki continues to travel and preach, maintaining his ministry across the United States.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Where is Andrea Yates now?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-71521992.jpg\" alt=\"Andrea Yates Found Not Guilty By Reason Of Insanity\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrea was <a href=\"https://time.com/archive/6919461/andrea-yates-returns-to-court/\" >retried in 2006</a>. While the arguments from both sides remained largely the same, the second jury reached a different conclusion. On July 26, 2006, Andrea Yates was found not guilty by reason of insanity. Under Texas law, the verdict resulted in her commitment to a state psychiatric hospital rather than release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was initially placed in a high-security psychiatric facility and later transferred to the Kerrville State Hospital, a maximum-security psychiatric center, where she remains. Andrea is eligible for periodic reviews regarding her confinement but has consistently declined to seek release, choosing to remain under psychiatric care.</p>\n",

But after being deposed and <a href=\"https://time.com/7342941/venezuela-maduro-bombing-trump-delta-force/\" >captured by American forces</a>, he abruptly finds himself in very different environs: behind the bars of a notorious Brooklyn jail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Metropolitan Detention Center lies in the relatively quiet neighborhood of Sunset Park, where it houses roughly 1,300 inmates in an industrial area near the waterfront. The jail, which has been the scene of a number of deaths and instances of alleged abuse and neglect, has previously been described as &ldquo;barbaric&rdquo; and &ldquo;hell on earth&rdquo; by judges and lawyers. Several other high-profile offenders have passed through its cells as they awaited trial in recent years, from singer R. Kelly to Fyre Festival organizer Billy McFarland to Jeffrey Epstein&rsquo;s long-time associate <a href=\"https://time.com/7305582/ghislaine-maxwell-epstein-trump-doj/\" >Ghislaine Maxwell</a>.

In May 2018, a former lieutenant at the M.D.C, Eugenio Perez, was convicted of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/nyregion/ex-lieutenant-at-federal-jail-convicted-of-sexually-assaulting-inmates.html\"  target=\"_blank\">sexually assaulting five female inmates</a> who prosecutors said he forced to perform oral sex on him. A jury separately found former lieutenant Carlos Richard Martinez <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/19/nyregion/jail-guard-convicted-rape.html\"  target=\"_blank\">guilty</a> of repeatedly raping a female inmate that January. Months earlier, former corrections officer Armando Moronta <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/usao-edny/pr/former-federal-correctional-officer-sentenced-10-years-prison-sexual-abuse-bribery-and\"  target=\"_blank\">pleaded guilty</a> to sexually abusing three female inmates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reports and attorneys have also raised accusations of unsanitary and dangerous conditions at the jail. In late January 2019, for instance, over a thousand inmates at the M.D.C.were left in freezing cells after the facility lost power and heat for at least a week, The New York<em> Times</em> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/01/nyregion/mdc-brooklyn-jail-heat.html\"  target=\"_blank\">reported</a>, citing federal public defenders and the corrections officers&rsquo; union. One federal defender said they had been told by an inmate that a corrections officer measured the temperature in a housing unit at 34 degrees, and that cells had been colder still.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Bureau of Prisons acknowledged an electrical failure at the time and said it was tied to Con Edison. The utility disputed that claim, saying the outage was an internal problem at the jail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In another instance, an attorney for Joseph Elias, who pleaded guilty to conspiracy to use fire to commit a felony and was held at the jail for more than 20 months, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.482542/gov.uscourts.nyed.482542.63.0.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">alleged</a> in May 2024 that his client was served food containing maggots in the M.D.C.&rsquo;s segregated housing unit, as well as meals including fish, despite a documented allergy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The same year, two inmates were killed at the jail. In June 2024, Uriel Whyte was fatally stabbed by two inmates while awaiting trial on weapons possession charges, according to the <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/federal-charges-announced-against-inmates-violent-crimes-committed-metropolitan-detention\"  target=\"_blank\">Justice Department</a>. A month later, Edwin Cordero, who was serving time for assault in violation of his supervised release after serving time for wire fraud, was allegedly beaten and stabbed in the heart by three inmates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That September, a federal judge threatened to vacate the prison sentence of a 75-year-old convicted on tax fraud charges if he were designated to serve time at the M.D.C. and instead place the man on house arrest, citing &ldquo;<a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.nyed.504665/gov.uscourts.nyed.504665.13.0.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">dangerous, barbaric conditions</a>&rdquo; at the Brooklyn jail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The facility &#8220;is hell on earth for anyone unfortunate enough to live there,&#8221; Mark Bederow, a criminal-defense attorney and former Manhattan prosecutor, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/sean-diddy-combs-metropolitan-detention-center-brooklyn-jail-indictment-2024-9\"  target=\"_blank\">told</a> <em>Business Insider</em> following news that Sean &ldquo;Diddy&rdquo; Combs would be transferred to the M.D.C. that month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a <a href=\"https://legalaidnyc.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Statement-on-ICE-Detaining-People-at-Beleaguered-Federal-Detention-Center-in-Brooklyn-1.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">press release</a> last June, the Legal Aid Society described the jail as having a &#8220;documented history of violence, medical neglect, and human and civil rights violations.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amid the deaths and accusations, the M.D.C. has continued to hold hundreds of inmates&mdash;including some of the country&rsquo;s most infamous accused criminals. The Venezuelan president and his wife join Luigi Mangione, who faces state and federal charges in the December 2024 killing of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, as current denizens of the notorious jail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href=\"https://time.com/7343019/venezuela-trump-oil-china/\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>How Trump&rsquo;s Venezuela Takeover Could Change the World</em></a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another ex-Latin American leader, former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hern&aacute;ndez, was also recently detained there while awaiting trial on drug charges after his 2022 extradition. While at the jail, Hern&aacute;ndez <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/20/nyregion/sam-bankman-fried-jailhouse-lawyer.html\"  target=\"_blank\">received legal advice</a> from yet another high-profile inmate: the founder of the bankrupt bitcoin exchange FTX, Sam Bankman-Fried.

On that date, the department released an initial, incomplete batch of records, saying that hundreds of thousands more were expected to come in the weeks ahead. More documents and images were released in additional batches in the following days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Dec. 24, the DOJ said it had identified over a million additional documents potentially related to Epstein that would require additional time to review. In the Monday update, the officials said that a &ldquo;meaningful portion&rdquo; of the documents appeared to be duplicative but noted that they will need to undergo a &ldquo;deduplication&rdquo; process.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The officials again attributed the delay in releasing the files in part to the need to take steps to protect the victims referenced within them. The law allows for some information to be redacted from the files in order to protect the identities of victims, among other circumstances.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://x.com/MacFarlaneNews/status/2003132974678892750/photo/1\"  target=\"_blank\">group</a> of Epstein survivors in December, however, denounced the DOJ&rsquo;s initial releases of the files for leaving what they described as &ldquo;numerous victim identities&rdquo; unredacted, even while elsewhere making &ldquo;abnormal and extreme redactions&rdquo; to the materials&mdash;which included a number of fully blacked out pages&mdash;&ldquo;with no explanation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read more: </strong><em><a href=\"https://time.com/7342581/jeffrey-epstein-doj-justice-department-files-documents-redactions/\" >What&rsquo;s Redacted in the New Epstein Files and What Isn&rsquo;t</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer <a href=\"https://x.com/senschumer/status/2008232235673989381?s=46\"  target=\"_blank\">on Monday</a> also criticized the DOJ for failing to submit a report to Congress including a list of political figures named in the files.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Trump&rsquo;s DOJ has failed to submit a report to Congress, which is required to include a list of all government officials and politically exposed persons named or referenced in the released materials, without redactions,&rdquo; he wrote in a post on X. &ldquo;What are they trying to hide?&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Democratic lawmaker <a href=\"https://x.com/senschumer/status/2008232235673989381?s=46\"  target=\"_blank\">accused</a> the department of &ldquo;lawlessness&rdquo; and said he would &ldquo;do everything in my power to ensure all the files come out.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After months of Republican pushback, the Epstein Files Transparency Act was ultimately passed by both houses of Congress in mid-November with broad bipartisan support and&nbsp; <a href=\"https://time.com/7335230/trump-signs-epstein-files-bill/\" >signed by Trump</a> after the President reversed his own opposition to the measure and urged Republicans to support it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is unclear when the next trove of documents will be released by the DOJ, or how long it will take for all files to be released.&nbsp;</p>\n",

He&rsquo;s a dictator.&rsquo; They always call me a dictator.&rdquo;</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&rsquo;s comments were part of a freewheeling address that also included complaints about his polling numbers ahead of the <a href=\"https://time.com/7331992/democrats-dnc-memo-elections/\" >midterm elections</a> and fresh musings about serving beyond the constitutionally mandated two-term limit. Most polls show Trump&rsquo;s approval rating hovering around 40%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I wish you could explain to me what the hell is going on with the mind of the public because we have the right policy,&rdquo; said Trump, who usually insists bad polls about him were rigged.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;You gotta win the midterms. Because if we don&#8217;t win the midterms, they&#8217;ll find a reason to impeach me,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I&#8217;ll get impeached.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Read More</strong>: <em><a href=\"https://time.com/7343574/trump-impeachment-calls-gather-pace-venezuela-fallout/\" >Calls for Trump&rsquo;s Impeachment Gain Momentum Amid Fallout Over Venezuela Operation</a></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Federal law leaves no room for a president to cancel or postpone congressional elections. The timing of federal elections is set by Congress, and the administration of elections is carried out by the states, with oversight by Congress and the courts. Even under emergencies such as war or natural disaster, there is no clear legal mechanism for a president to unilaterally suspend national elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that hasn&rsquo;t stopped Trump from repeatedly flirting with the idea, which has alarmed Democrats and voting rights advocates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his first term, he publicly suggested delaying the 2020 election, despite lacking the authority to do so. More recently, in a meeting in August with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, Trump appeared to voice approval of Ukraine&rsquo;s ban on elections under martial law, prompting laughter in the room but alarm among his critics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;So you say during the war, you can&rsquo;t have elections,&rdquo; Trump said to Zelensky at the time. &ldquo;So let me just say, three and a half years from now&mdash;so you mean, if we happen to be in a war with somebody, no more elections? Oh, that&rsquo;s good.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His comments came on the fifth anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, when a pro-Trump mob stormed the building in an effort to stop Congress from certifying Trump&rsquo;s 2020 election loss, a result that Trump has never accepted. During his speech Tuesday, he again falsely claimed that the 2020 election had been &ldquo;rigged,&rdquo; repeating unsubstantiated allegations of widespread voter fraud that have been rejected by courts, election officials from both parties, and members of his own former administration.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;The election was rigged,&rdquo; Trump told the House Republican Conference. &ldquo;You ought to have voter ID. You ought to insist on it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added, &ldquo;We got to straighten this out before it gets too crazy,&rdquo; arguing that opposition to voter identification laws was proof of corruption. &ldquo;When somebody says, &lsquo;No, we don&rsquo;t want voter ID,&rsquo; that means they&rsquo;re crooked,&rdquo; he said, without evidence.</p>\n",

If you&#8217;re reading this in your browser, why not <a href=\"http://timeintheloop.beehiiv.com/subscribe\"  target=\"_blank\">subscribe</a> to have the next one delivered straight to your inbox?</p>\n\n\n\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">What to Know: A Dangerous Demo</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Late last year, an AI researcher opened his laptop and showed me something jaw-dropping.</p>\n\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n<p>Lucas Hansen, co-founder of nonprofit CivAI, was showing me an app he built that coaxed popular AI models into giving what appeared to be detailed step-by-step instructions for creating poliovirus and anthrax. Any safeguards that these models had were stripped away. The app had a user-friendly interface; with the click of a button, the model would clarify any given step. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading AI companies have been warning for years that their models might soon be able to help novices create dangerous pathogens&mdash;potentially sparking a deadly pandemic, or enabling a bioterror attack. In the face of these risks, companies like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic have tightened safety mechanisms for their latest generation of more powerful models, which are better at resisting so-called &ldquo;jailbreaking&rdquo; attempts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on Hansen&rsquo;s laptop, I was watching an older class of models&mdash;Gemini 2.0 Flash and Claude 3.5 Sonnet&mdash;seemingly oblige bioweapon-related requests. Gemini also gave what appeared to be step-by-step instructions for building a bomb and a 3D-printed ghost gun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wait a sec &mdash; </strong>I&rsquo;m no biologist, and I had no way of confirming that the recipes on Hansen&rsquo;s screen would have actually worked. Even model outputs that appear convincing at first glance might not work in practice. Anthropic, for example, has conducted what it calls &ldquo;uplift trials,&rdquo; where independent experts assess the degree to which AI models could help a novice create dangerous pathogens. By their measure, Claude 3.5 Sonnet didn&rsquo;t meet a threshold for danger. In a statement, a Google spokesperson said: &ldquo;Safety is a priority and we take such issues very seriously. We don&#8217;t allow usage of our models to engage in this sort of behavior, but because we aren&rsquo;t able to review the research, we cannot verify its accuracy. It&rsquo;s important for an expert with a CBRN [Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear] background to assess the prompts and responses to understand their accuracy and potential for replication.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Tips and tricks &mdash; </strong>But Siddharth Hiregowdara, another CivAI co-founder, says that his team ran the models&rsquo; outputs past independent biology and virology experts, who confirmed that the steps were &ldquo;by and large correct.&rdquo; The older models, he says, can still give correct details down to the specific DNA sequences that a user could order from an online retailer, and specific catalog numbers for other lab tools to be ordered online. &ldquo;Then it gives you tips and tricks,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;One of the misconceptions people have is that AI is going to lack this tacit knowledge of the real world in the lab. But really, AI is super helpful for that.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A new lobbying tool &mdash; </strong>It goes without saying that this app is not available to the public. But its makers have already taken it on a tour of Washington, D.C., giving two dozen or so private demonstrations to the offices of lawmakers, national security officials, and Congressional committees, in an attempt to viscerally demonstrate to policymakers the power of what AI can do today, so that they begin to take the technology more seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Shock and awe &mdash;</strong> &ldquo;One pretty noteworthy meeting was with some senior staff at a congressional office on the national security/intelligence side,&rdquo; says Hiregowdara. &ldquo;They said that two weeks ago a major AI company&#8217;s lobbyists had come in and talked with them. And so we showed them this demo, where the AI comes up with really detailed instructions for constructing some biological threat. They were shocked. They were like: &lsquo;The AI company lobbyists told us that they have guardrails preventing this kind of behavior.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">Who to Know: Nick Turley, Head of ChatGPT</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Nick Turley used to be anonymous. He could return to small-town Germany, where he is from, or wander the streets of San Francisco, where he lives, without anybody knowing his work. This is no longer true. As OpenAI&rsquo;s head of ChatGPT, Turley now meets passionate users of his product wherever he travels in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;That feels categorically different in 2025 versus earlier,&rdquo; he told me when we spoke at the tail end of last year. Turley was reflecting on a year when ChatGPT usage more than doubled to over 800 million users, or 10% of the world&rsquo;s population. &ldquo;That leaves at least 90% to go,&rdquo; he said, with an entirely straight face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One thing I wanted to ask Turley about was OpenAI&rsquo;s plans for turning a profit, as the company is currently losing billions of dollars per year. His boss Sam Altman has mused publicly about putting ads into ChatGPT, and I asked him what he thought of that idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I want to live in a world where we can offer our smartest model capabilities to all users around the world. And for that reason, I feel like we actually have a moral duty to explore all possible business models that can maximize access around the world, and ads is one of them,&rdquo; Turley said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The company, he added, is debating internally whether ads would introduce a conflict of interest into ChatGPT, raising questions of whether the chatbot was serving the user&rsquo;s interests first, or the advertiser&rsquo;s. &ldquo;If you were to do something like that [introducing ads],&rdquo; Turley told me, &ldquo;you&#8217;d want to be very principled, and you&#8217;d want to communicate the principles of how it works.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">AI in Action</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>40 million people use ChatGPT for health advice, according to an OpenAI report first shared with Axios. That makes up more than 5% of all ChatGPT messages globally, by Axios&rsquo; calculations. &ldquo;Users turn to ChatGPT to decode medical bills, spot overcharges, appeal insurance denials, and when access to doctors is limited, some even use it to self-diagnose or manage their care,&rdquo; the outlet <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/05/chatgpt-openai-health-insurance-aca\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr/>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-center\">What We&rsquo;re Reading</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.transformernews.ai/p/claude-code-is-about-so-much-more\"  target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Claude Code is about so much more than coding</strong></a>, in <em>Transformer</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shakeel Hashim writes: &ldquo;This is crucial to understanding why Claude Code has implications for everyone, not just the developers that have already been wowed by it.

However, while the Trump Administration celebrates what it considers to be a win, others have voiced serious concerns about the way in which the U.S. conducted its assault.</p>\n[time-brightcove not-tgx=&#8221;true&#8221;]\n\n\n\n\n<p>The United Nations on Tuesday said the action from the U.S. has made &ldquo;<a href=\"https://news.un.org/en/story/2026/01/1166707\"  target=\"_blank\">all States less safe around the world</a>.&rdquo; This follows significant criticism and<a href=\"https://time.com/7342925/venezuela-maduro-capture-reaction/\" > caution</a> from world leaders regarding the Venezuela operation. Furthermore, since Saturday&rsquo;s pre-dawn raid in Caracas, Trump has threatened that the U.S. may carry out <a href=\"https://time.com/7343093/trump-venezuela-us-next-colombia-cuba-greenland-iran-mexico/\" >interventions</a> elsewhere in the world, prompting further concern and <a href=\"https://time.com/7343110/trump-greenland-annex-threats-nielsen-responds/\" >disapproval</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At home in the U.S., calls for the President&rsquo;s impeachment are now gaining momentum, as some Democratic lawmakers, along with prominent figures in the political space, demand that action be taken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep.

Nancy Pelosi&rsquo;s Congress seat</a>, has called for Trump to be impeached over, what he refers to as, the &ldquo;illegal invasion and coup in Venezuela.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Trump illegally invaded Venezuela, seizing and bombing the capitol, seizing the country&rsquo;s oil assets, and taking President Maduro and his wife prisoner,&rdquo; said Weiner in <a href=\"https://sd11.senate.ca.gov/news/senator-wiener-calls-trumps-impeachment-his-illegal-invasion-and-coup-venezuela\"  target=\"_blank\">a press release</a> issued on Jan. 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Trump has no legal authority to invade Venezuela, given lack of authorization by Congress. This lawless act is yet another impeachable offense by this thug President,&rdquo; claimed Wiener, who cited concerns that the President&rsquo;s actions could prompt &ldquo;China to invade Taiwan and Russia to escalate its conquest in Ukraine.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-gutenberg-custom-blocks-inline-image\"><img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/scott-wiener-impeachment-nov18.jpg\" alt=\"Senator Scott Wiener and advocates announce the No Kings Act\" alignment=\"center\"/><p class=\"article_header\"></p><p class=\"article_subheading\"></p><p class=\"article_text\"></p></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep.

But they are not&hellip; Trump must be impeached,&rdquo; said Ramirez, who called for the <a href=\"https://omar.house.gov/media/press-releases/rep-ilhan-omar-cpc-leaders-introduce-war-powers-resolution-end-unauthorized\"  target=\"_blank\">War Powers Resolution</a>, submitted by Rep.

Dan Goldman of New York <a href=\"https://goldman.house.gov/media/press-releases/representative-dan-goldmans-statement-president-trumps-actions-venezuela\"  target=\"_blank\">accused Trump</a> of using the same &ldquo;illegal and unconstitutional tactics as Maduro&rdquo; in the operation, saying that such action &ldquo;not only undermines our democracy and violates our Constitution but also emboldens dictators around the world.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;I believe President Trump&rsquo;s true motivation is to take control of Venezuela&rsquo;s vast oil resources as a favor to American oil executives who helped get him elected,&rdquo; alleged Goldman, who referred to the operation as a &ldquo;violation of the United States Constitution&rdquo; that amounts to &ldquo;an impeachable offense.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Maxine Waters of California, who is also co-chair of the Congressional Caribbean Caucus, <a href=\"https://democrats-financialservices.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=414082\"  target=\"_blank\">said</a> that Trump had no authority &ldquo;to bypass Congress to launch military strikes against a sovereign nation, while brazenly admitting that controlling Venezuela&#8217;s oil is part of his motivation.&rdquo;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;Many Democrats have understandably questioned whether impeachment is possible again under the current political reality. I am reconsidering that view,&rdquo; said Waters in reference to previous attempts to impeach Trump during his first term as President.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an email to TIME on Monday, the White House defended the Venezuela operation and accused Democrats of taking &ldquo;twisted stands&rdquo; in the wake of the military intervention.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&ldquo;At President Trump&rsquo;s direction, the Administration lawfully executed a federal arrest warrant against Nicol&aacute;s Maduro, which was issued by a federal judge for Maduro&rsquo;s corrupt and criminal actions as a narcoterrorist trafficking illicit narcotics into the United States,&rdquo; said White House deputy press secretary Anna Kelly.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>When has Trump previously faced impeachment?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2019, <a href=\"https://time.com/5746997/articles-of-impeachment-donald-trump/\" >Trump faced two articles of impeachment</a> when he was <a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hres755/BILLS-116hres755enr.pdf\"  target=\"_blank\">accused</a> of leveraging foreign assistance to Ukraine in order to coerce the country&rsquo;s new Administration to investigate Joe Biden, who at the time was the former Vice President.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The House of Representatives <a href=\"https://time.com/5751699/donald-trump-impeached/\" >voted</a> mostly along party lines to impeach the President, sending the case to the Senate.
