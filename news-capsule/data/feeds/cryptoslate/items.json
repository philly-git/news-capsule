      "content": "<p>On paper, the U.S. national debt is a number so big it stops feeling real. Trillions do that to your brain.</p>\n<p>So let’s bring it back down to human size for a second.</p>\n<p>If you spread today’s federal debt across U.S. households, you land at roughly $285,000 per household, depending on the day you do the math.</p>\n<p>The number moves around with Treasury cash management. The estimate uses the government’s own daily debt tally from <a href=\"https://fiscaldata.treasury.gov/datasets/debt-to-the-penny/\">Treasury</a> and the St. Louis Fed’s household count from <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TTLHH\">FRED</a>.</p>\n<p>It’s an unusual way to view the world, but it makes the whole thing feel suddenly personal.</p>\n<p>The viral version of this story says U.S. federal debt hit $38.5 trillion in 2025, up $2.3 trillion in a year, rising by about $6.3 billion a day, and heading to $40 trillion by August.</p>\n<p>The parts that matter are broadly true. The exact “$38.5 trillion” figure is a snapshot that depends on the date you pull.</p>\n<p>As of Dec. 29, 2025, the Treasury’s “Debt to the Penny” dataset shows total public debt outstanding at about $38.386 trillion. That is still staggering, and the direction is still the point.</p>\n<p>The “$40 trillion by August” line is the one that needs a calendar check.</p>\n<p>If debt grows at roughly $5–$7 billion per day from the high-$38 trillion range, you can get to $40 trillion on a late-summer timeline. It just fits better as a 2026 story than a 2025 one.</p>\n<p>The bigger idea is that the pace is fast enough that the milestone is no longer a distant, abstract decade marker. It’s close enough to plan around.</p>\n<p>And planning around it matters for Bitcoin, because this is not only a politics story.</p>\n<p>It’s a market plumbing story, a liquidity story, and increasingly, a crypto market structure story.</p>\n<h2>Debt headlines are loud, the interest bill is louder</h2>\n<p>There are two numbers in this debate: the stock, which is the debt, and the flow, which is the deficit that keeps adding to it.</p>\n<p>The Congressional Budget Office <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61306\">estimates</a> the federal budget deficit totaled about $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2025. That is the ongoing engine that keeps feeding the debt pile.</p>\n<p>Then there’s the part that makes traders sit up straight: the interest cost of carrying that pile.</p>\n<p>The Treasury’s own fiscal year results, as reported widely from Treasury data, show interest expense hitting a record $1.216 trillion for fiscal 2025. When your interest bill is measured in trillions, you start to understand why bond investors obsess over the direction of yields.</p>\n<p>This is the pivot point for crypto. Bitcoin’s “hard money” story tends to resonate most when people worry about the dollar's long-term purchasing power.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin’s “risk asset” behavior tends to show up when real yields rise, liquidity tightens, and investors start cutting exposure.</p>\n<p>The U.S. debt trajectory can push both forces at once. The market decides which one matters more.</p>\n<h2>The bond market is where this becomes a Bitcoin story</h2>\n<p>Bond investors don’t trade memes. They trade math, supply, and confidence.</p>\n<p>A recent Reuters piece <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/tenuous-peace-between-trump-30-trillion-us-bond-market-2025-12-29/\">described</a> a fragile calm in the U.S. bond market after bouts of volatility in 2025, pointing out how sensitive Treasuries have become to policy shocks, spending signals, and refinancing fears.</p>\n<p>It also noted something crypto traders should not ignore: stablecoin issuers are becoming a meaningful source of demand for short-term U.S. debt.</p>\n<p>That detail is the hinge.</p>\n<p>For years, crypto has watched the Treasury market like it’s the weather, something outside the window that changes the mood of everything else.</p>\n<p>Now parts of crypto are starting to sit inside the Treasury market, buying bills as reserves, affecting flows at the margin, and tightening the link between crypto sentiment and the world’s most important collateral.</p>\n<p>Stablecoin growth is driving demand for T-bills and repo, with a large share of reserves parked in short-duration instruments.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/how-tethers-127b-in-us-treasuries-will-hit-top-5-foreign-holders-by-2033/\" class=\"cs-article-embed__link\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/tether-top-holder-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"How Tether’s $127B in US Treasuries will hit top-5 foreign holders by 2033\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"cs-article-embed__body\">\n            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__related-reading\">Related Reading</span>\n            <h3 class=\"cs-article-embed__title\">How Tether’s $127B in US Treasuries will hit top-5 foreign holders by 2033</h3>\n                            <p class=\"cs-article-embed__summary\">$1T question: Could Tether ever be the largest foreign holder of U.S. debt?</p>\n                                        <div class=\"cs-article-embed__meta\">\n                                            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Oct 11, 2025</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-divider\">&middot;</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Liam &#039;Akiba&#039;

But markets care most about the direction of yields and the cost of money.</p>\n<p>Historically, this is where Bitcoin can find its cleanest runway, because the “cheap money” reflex returns.</p>\n<p><strong>3) The tantrum, auction nerves, policy shock, or inflation flareup</strong></p>\n<p>This is the tail scenario, and it’s messy. Supply concerns meet a catalyst, and the bond market demands higher yields quickly.</p>\n<p>Risk assets usually sell first, Bitcoin included. Then the narrative can change if the policy response starts to look like financial repression, more reliance on bills and more interventions to keep funding costs contained.</p>\n<p>That’s the environment where Bitcoin’s hedge story can reappear after the initial hit.</p>\n<p>If you want a baseline for why this keeps coming back, CBO’s longer-range projections have federal debt rising to very high levels relative to GDP over the coming decade.</p>\n<p>That keeps the refinancing question alive even when markets are calm.</p>\n<h2>Why this feels close to home, even for people who never trade</h2>\n<p>The debt number is easy to scroll past until you realize it leaks into ordinary life through the price of credit.</p>\n<p>When the Treasury has to fund big deficits, it sells more paper. When that supply rises, yields can rise, and borrowing costs across the economy can follow.</p>\n<p>Mortgage rates, auto loans, business loans, revolving credit, they all live downstream of the “risk-free” curve.</p>\n<p>That is where the human side of this story sits. People feel “the debt” when their payment jumps.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin sits in a strange position in that world.</p>\n<p>It is an escape hatch for some people, a speculative asset for others, and a global bet that the monetary system will keep changing.</p>\n<p>The bigger the debt gets, the more attention the system’s plumbing gets, and the more plausible Bitcoin feels as a long-term alternative to anyone who has lost faith that the rules will stay stable.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Bitcoin is still priced in dollars, still traded on platforms connected to the banking system, and still sensitive to liquidity.</p>\n<p>So rising debt can strengthen the cultural case for Bitcoin while weakening the short-term trading case, depending on what it does to yields and risk appetite.</p>\n<p>That tension is the real story.</p>\n<h2>The underappreciated twist, crypto is becoming a Treasury buyer</h2>\n<p>There’s a detail here that would have sounded absurd a few years ago.</p>\n<p>As stablecoins grow, their issuers have to hold more short-duration, highly liquid reserves, and that often means U.S. Treasuries.</p>\n<p>Researchers and think tanks are now writing openly about the link between stablecoins and Treasury market dynamics, including the risk that stablecoin outflows could force rapid selling in stress. <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-rise-of-stablecoins-and-implications-for-treasury-markets/\">Brookings</a></p>\n<p>So the next time the U.S. debt number hits another round milestone, pay attention to who is quietly buying the bills.</p>\n<p>Crypto is no longer only reacting to the Treasury market from the outside. It is helping fund it.</p>\n<h2>What to watch next</h2>\n<p>If you want to stay forward-looking, there are a few concrete dates and signals that matter more than the next viral debt post.</p>\n<p>CBO is scheduled to release its next major baseline outlook, “The Budget and Economic Outlook: 2026 to 2036,” on Feb. 11, 2026.</p>\n<p>That <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/61954\">update</a> will refresh the market’s default assumptions about deficits, debt, and growth.</p>\n<p>On the Treasury side, the quarterly refunding process and buyback schedule keep signaling how the government plans to finance itself.</p>\n<p>That <a href=\"https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financing-the-government/quarterly-refunding/most-recent-quarterly-refunding-documents\">includes</a> how much it leans on short-term bills versus longer-dated bonds.</p>\n<p>On the Fed side, watch whether reserve-management purchases continue through spring, as Reuters reported staff discussions that highlighted the risk of reserves getting too tight around tax season.</p>\n<h2>Closing thought</h2>\n<p>The U.S. debt number is going to keep climbing. That part is the easiest forecast in markets.</p>\n<p>The harder forecast is how investors will feel about it in the moment, and whether the response shows up as higher yields, easier liquidity, or a little of both.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin lives in that gap between faith and funding, between the story people tell themselves about money and the actual plumbing that makes markets work.</p>\n<p>That gap is getting wider, and that’s why this debt story keeps landing on crypto’s doorstep.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-faces-a-40-trillion-test-as-us-debt-races-higher-but-one-hidden-buyer-is-changing-everything/\">Bitcoin faces a $40 trillion test as US debt races higher but one hidden buyer is changing everything</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a> has stormed into 2026 by rising to its <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-breaks-94000-for-the-first-time-in-one-month-why-crypto-is-up-today/\">highest level in over a month</a> after climbing above $94,000 on Jan. 5, signaling a potential end to the stagnation that plagued the crypto market in late 2025.</p>\n<p>This rally marks a decisive shift in sentiment, given that the flagship digital asset closed the previous year with a whimper while equities reached record highs.</p>\n<p>However, that trend appears reversed, with the first trading sessions of the new year delivering a modest but significant reversal.</p>\n<p>During this period, Bitcoin is up over 3% year-to-date and is showing renewed vigor, driven by a confluence of favorable macroeconomic conditions, resurgent institutional demand, and a cleaner derivatives market.</p>\n<h2>The macro shift</h2>\n<p>Underpinning this nascent recovery is a transforming macroeconomic landscape in the United States. Heading into 2026, two reinforcing trends are reshaping the investment climate: a steepening yield curve and a structurally weaker dollar.</p>\n<p>Analysts at Bitfinex told <em>CryptoSlate</em> that the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-2026-real-yields-etf-flows-bofa-jpmorgan/\">US Treasury curve</a> has moved decisively out of the inverted state that characterized the 2022–2024 period.</p>\n<p>This normalization is driven by expectations of eventual policy easing at the front end, coupled with elevated long-dated yields stemming from inflation uncertainty and fiscal concerns.</p>\n<p>They furthered that this configuration reflects a repricing of duration and credibility risk rather than renewed growth optimism. In this environment, financial conditions remain tighter than headline rate cuts would suggest, creating a backdrop where liquidity improves only selectively.</p>\n<p>Simultaneously, the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/us-dollar-decline-pushed-bitcoin-above-120k-bringing-hyper-bitcoinization-closer/\">US dollar has weakened</a> meaningfully.</p>\n<p>While the greenback’s structural foundations remain intact—supported by deep capital markets and demand for Treasuries—the current depreciation appears managed, reflecting policy preferences for improved trade competitiveness.</p>\n<p>This combination of a softer dollar and elevated long-end yields favors assets with &#8220;real&#8221; or defensive characteristics and near-term pricing power.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin, often viewed as a hedge against fiat debasement and liquidity expansion, stands to benefit directly from this regime.</p>\n<h2>Institutional Bitcoin appetite returns</h2>\n<p>Beyond the macro headwinds turning into tailwinds, the specific drivers of Bitcoin’s price action are increasingly institutional in nature.</p>\n<p>The pace of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-etf-fatigue-is-real-ignoring-noise-these-are-the-10-days-that-mattered-in-2025/\">ETF-driven selling,</a> which dampened price action late last year, slowed materially into year-end. As liquidity conditions improve in early 2026, the market is already seeing the impact.</p>\n<p>In the first two trading days of the year alone, <a href=\"https://www.coinperps.com/etf/bitcoin\">data</a> from Coinperps shows that Bitcoin ETFs have recorded over $1 billion in inflows, signaling that institutional capital is rotating back into the asset class.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, this renewed demand is not limited to passive funds, as <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/market-reports/bitcoin-treasury-companies-hedge-or-house-of-cards/\">Bitcoin treasury firms</a> are also accumulating BTC.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_513754\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-513754\" style=\"width: 2560px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img fetchpriority=\"high\" decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-513754\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G98mRWKbcAYjUEr-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin Treasury Companies\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1368\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G98mRWKbcAYjUEr-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G98mRWKbcAYjUEr-300x160.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G98mRWKbcAYjUEr-1024x547.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G98mRWKbcAYjUEr-768x410.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G98mRWKbcAYjUEr-1536x821.jpg 1536w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G98mRWKbcAYjUEr-2048x1094.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-513754\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Bitcoin Treasury Companies BTC Purchases (Source: Capriole)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>Charles Edwards, the CEO of Capriole, <a href=\"https://x.com/caprioleio/status/2008366104574402972\">noted</a>:</p>\n<blockquote><p>&#8220;Bitcoin treasury companies just flipped to net buying again&#8230;Institutions are once again net buyers of Bitcoin.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\n<p>Indeed, the market has seen an increasing number of BTC treasury companies announce new purchases recently.</p>\n<p>For context, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/microstrategy/\">Strategy Inc.

      "content": "<p>On Monday, January 5, something small on paper becomes huge in practice, the moment a mainstream American wealth adviser can finally say the quiet part out loud.</p>\n<p>Bank of America’s wealth platforms, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expands-crypto-access-wealth-management-clients-2025-12-04/\">Merrill</a>, <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expands-crypto-access-wealth-management-clients-2025-12-04/\">Bank of America Private Bank</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expands-crypto-access-wealth-management-clients-2025-12-04/\">Merrill Edge</a>, are set to let advisers recommend crypto exchange-traded products, with an internal view that a “modest” <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expands-crypto-access-wealth-management-clients-2025-12-04/\">1% to 4%</a> allocation can make sense for clients who can live with the swings.</p>\n<p>That might sound like a footnote in a market that has lived through everything from meme mania to outright collapses, yet this is one of the clearest signs that Bitcoin’s next chapter is being written inside the kind of offices where people still print out risk questionnaires.</p>\n<p>### The human moment, a client question, an adviser answer</p>\n<p>Picture the average wealth client, not a day trader, not a crypto native, someone who owns a broad mix of stocks and bonds, maybe a few funds they have held for years.</p>\n<p>They have heard about Bitcoin for a decade, they have watched friends brag at the top, disappear at the bottom, then quietly come back, and they have mostly done nothing. Even when spot bitcoin ETFs arrived, many clients were still stuck in the same awkward loop, curiosity on one side, permission on the other.</p>\n<p>Bank of America’s change breaks that loop. Starting <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expands-crypto-access-wealth-management-clients-2025-12-04/\">January 5, 2026</a>, advisers move from simply executing a trade to being able to recommend regulated crypto products as part of a portfolio, which matters because advice is where habits form. When something gets framed as “a small sleeve” rather than “a punt,” it stops being a late-night decision and starts becoming a line item.</p>\n<p>### What clients are actually being offered</p>\n<p>In practice, this first step looks very Bitcoin-heavy.</p>\n<p>Industry reporting says the initial shelf includes four bitcoin ETPs, including the <a href=\"https://www.wealthmanagement.com/crypto/bank-of-america-broadens-access-to-crypto-funds\">Bitwise</a> Bitcoin ETF, <a href=\"https://www.wealthmanagement.com/crypto/bank-of-america-broadens-access-to-crypto-funds\">Grayscale</a>’s Bitcoin Mini Trust, <a href=\"https://www.wealthmanagement.com/crypto/bank-of-america-broadens-access-to-crypto-funds\">Fidelity</a>’s Wise Origin Bitcoin Fund, and BlackRock’s <a href=\"https://www.wealthmanagement.com/crypto/bank-of-america-broadens-access-to-crypto-funds\">iShares</a> Bitcoin Trust.</p>\n<p>There’s also an important operational detail here, advisers reportedly need <a href=\"https://www.wealthmanagement.com/crypto/bank-of-america-broadens-access-to-crypto-funds\">training</a> to participate, plus an implementation and allocation guidance paper from the chief investment office. That’s boring, and it’s the point.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin doesn’t need another hype cycle. It needs distribution that can survive a bad month.</p>\n<p>### Why 1% to 4% can still be a big deal</p>\n<p>Four percent sounds tiny until you remember how wealth actually moves.</p>\n<p>Large advisory platforms rarely flip a switch and send billions into a new asset overnight. What they do is allow a product, build a process, teach the advisers how to talk about it, and let adoption crawl forward, client by client, review meeting by review meeting.</p>\n<p>That slow-motion adoption is exactly what makes this different from the typical crypto headline.</p>\n<p>Bank of America’s wealth unit is massive, Reuters reported the bank’s core wealth management business, including Merrill and its private bank, manages about <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-americas-wealth-unit-eyes-4-5-net-new-asset-growth-2025-11-05/\">$4.6 trillion</a> in client assets.</p>\n<p>Here’s a simple way to think about it.</p>\n<p>If only 5% of those assets eventually adopt a 2% Bitcoin sleeve, that’s around $4.6T x 5% x 2%, roughly $4.6 billion. If adoption reached 10% at a 4% sleeve, you get $18.4 billion. These are scenario ranges, not forecasts, and the main point is the same, small portfolio weights on huge platforms add up quickly.</p>\n<p>Even the low case matters because bitcoin ETF flows tend to arrive in bursts, and the marginal buyer often sets the price in crypto markets.</p>\n<p>### The timing, Bitcoin is bruised, still mainstream, and still volatile</p>\n<p>This shift lands after a year that reminded everyone what Bitcoin really is.</p>\n<p>Reuters reported bitcoin hit an all-time high above <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/bitcoin-set-first-yearly-loss-since-2022-macro-trends-weigh-crypto-2025-12-31/\">$126,000</a> in October 2025, then got hammered as macro shocks hit risk appetite, with analysts noting bitcoin’s growing tendency to trade like a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/bitcoin-set-first-yearly-loss-since-2022-macro-trends-weigh-crypto-2025-12-31/\">risk asset</a>.</p>\n<p>Bank of America itself pointed to the downside, Reuters noted bitcoin lost more than <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expands-crypto-access-wealth-management-clients-2025-12-04/\">$18,000 in November 2025</a>, its biggest monthly dollar drop since May 2021.</p>\n<p>That’s the backdrop, volatility is not fading away, it is being formalised.</p>\n<p>As of today, bitcoin is trading around <a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/\">$92,000</a>, according to CoinMarketCap, which also shows that October high and the distance from it. For long-time holders, this is familiar. For wealth clients who prefer smooth lines, it’s a warning label.</p>\n<p>### The macro layer, why this could matter even more in 2026</p>\n<p>A lot of the next move for bitcoin is going to be decided outside crypto.</p>\n<p>The Federal Reserve is currently targeting a fed funds range of <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/pressreleases/monetary20251210a1.htm\">3.50% to 3.75%</a>. Inflation, meanwhile, was running at <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/cpi/news.htm\">2.7%</a> year over year through November.</p>\n<p>Those numbers matter because crypto still lives on liquidity and sentiment. Easier money tends to help speculative assets breathe. Sticky inflation and rate uncertainty tend to do the opposite. Bitcoin has matured enough to show up in mainstream portfolios, it hasn’t matured enough to ignore the macro weather.</p>\n<p>This is why Bank of America’s framing is so telling. Advisers are being told to treat digital assets like a satellite sleeve for clients who can handle volatility, Reuters quoted the bank warning that <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/bank-america-expands-crypto-access-wealth-management-clients-2025-12-04/\">speculative activity</a> can push prices beyond “true utility.”</p>\n<p>That’s a traditional finance way of saying the quiet part again, bitcoin can be valuable, the ride can still be brutal.</p>\n<p>### What this unlocks for Bitcoin, and what it does not</p>\n<p>This does not instantly turn Bank of America into a crypto bank. It doesn’t guarantee a flood of inflows. It doesn’t erase the scars of 2022, or the hangover of late 2025.</p>\n<p>What it does is more durable.</p>\n<p>It puts bitcoin ETFs in the path of the most ordinary money in America, retirement rollovers, college funds, business owners who sold a company, families who do one portfolio review a year and then go back to living their lives.</p>\n<p>That’s the kind of demand bitcoin has always chased, because it’s less emotional, more process-driven, and it tends to stick around longer.</p>\n<p>The irony is that the allocation being discussed is small. The cultural shift is the big thing. Bitcoin keeps getting absorbed into the system it was built to route around, and every time that happens, the price story becomes less about a single catalyst and more about a slow grind of legitimacy, distribution, and macro conditions.</p>\n<p>January 5 is a calendar date. For bitcoin, it’s another step toward becoming the asset people stop arguing about at dinner, and start treating like an uncomfortable, volatile, increasingly unavoidable part of modern investing.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bank-of-america-advisers-can-finally-recommend-bitcoin-but-the-modest-allocation-is-the-bigger-shock/\">Bank of America advisers are finally recommending Bitcoin, but the “modest” allocation is the bigger shock</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>\n",

It was designed to set people free.</p>\n<p>That line from the Trustless Manifesto drew criticism when it was published, and Vitalik Buterin repeated it on Jan. 5.</p>\n<p>The argument: Ethereum's mission differs fundamentally from the efficiency game DeFi protocols compete in. The goal is not 4.5% yield versus 5.3%, not reducing latency from 473 milliseconds to 368, not trimming signup from three clicks to one.</p>\n<p>Ethereum's game is resilience: avoiding total losses when infrastructure collapses, governments turn hostile, or developers disappear. Resilience means keeping 2,000-millisecond latency at 2,000 milliseconds even when Cloudflare fails, sponsors declare bankruptcy, or users get deplatformed.</p>\n<p>Resilience is remaining a first-class participant regardless of geography or politics.</p>\n<p>This matters because <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a> anchors <a href=\"https://defillama.com/chain/ethereum\">nearly $74 billion of smart contract value</a> in its layer-1 alone, and <a href=\"https://app.rwa.xyz/\">over 65%</a> of tokenized real-world assets.</p>\n<p>Yet, the system designed to be the world computer sits on a surprisingly fragile stack of centralized chokepoints.</p>\n<p>The consensus protocol kept finalizing blocks, but the RPC provider's outdated client caused exchanges to crash. The blockchain kept running, but the CDN went dark, taking half the ecosystem offline.</p>\n<h2>Catastrophe avoidance over yield optimization</h2>\n<p>A recent report <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/397880472_Market_Reaction_Asymmetry_Infrastructure_Disruption_Dominance_Over_Regulatory_Uncertainty-Event_Study_Evidence_from_Cryptocurrency_Volatility\">quantifies the stakes</a>: infrastructure failures produce volatility shocks 5.7 times larger than regulatory announcements across major crypto assets. The tail risk of total loss of access, permanent fund lockup, and network halt matters more than incremental returns.</p>\n<p>A protocol offering a 5.3% yield is worthless if a configuration error can destroy the infrastructure.<br />\n<a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/people/vitalik-buterin/\">Vitalik Buterin's</a> framing captures this. Resilience is not about speed when everything works, but whether your application runs at all when infrastructure providers disappear or hosting platforms deplatform users.</p>\n<p>The 2,000-millisecond latency Ethereum delivers might be slower than Web2, but it keeps delivering even when Web2 systems stop entirely.</p>\n<p>Still, Ethereum's resilience promise faces practical tests.</p>\n<p>In November 2020, Infura, the default RPC provider for <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/products/metamask/\">MetaMask</a> and most DeFi apps, ran an outdated Geth client that diverged from the canonical chain.</p>\n<p>Exchanges halted Ethereum withdrawals, explorers showed conflicting states, and MakerDAO and Uniswap broke for users.</p>\n<p>Although the bug itself has been fixed and progress is being made on alternative RPC implementations, centralization remains the norm.

Client diversity worked.</p>\n<p>The problem is concentrated above: RPC access, relays, sequencers, and web front-ends introduce dependencies that disable user access even when the base layer functions.</p>\n<p>This is where Ethereum's resilience breaks: not in cryptography or consensus, but in the scaffolding connecting users to the protocol.</p>\n<h2>Centralized sequencers as economic chokepoints</h2>\n<p>Layer-2 sequencers concentrate both control and profit. Base captured over 50% of all rollup profits consistently throughout 2025, followed by Arbitrum.</p>\n<p>Arbitrum's sequencer is run by the Arbitrum Foundation, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/optimism/\">Optimism's</a> by the Optimism Foundation, Base's by Coinbase, and zkSync's is centralized.</p>\n<p>As a result, over 80% of the fees captured by Ethereum layer-2 in 2025 flowed to blockchains with centralized sequencers.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_513701\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-513701\" style=\"width: 1549px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-513701 size-full\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_PCk7AhXnaB.jpg\" alt=\"Ethereum layer-2 fee capture\" width=\"1549\" height=\"464\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_PCk7AhXnaB.jpg 1549w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_PCk7AhXnaB-300x90.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_PCk7AhXnaB-1024x307.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_PCk7AhXnaB-768x230.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_PCk7AhXnaB-1536x460.jpg 1536w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1549px) 100vw, 1549px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-513701\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Layer-2 transaction fee revenue by chain from 2025 through 2026, showing Base Chain leading with $337.74k over the last 30 days.

Astria attempted similar designs but shut down in 2025.</p>\n<p>The gap is not technical, but economic. Centralized sequencers deliver better UX and generate substantial revenue. Resilience requires accepting that a sequencer producing slightly slower confirmations, but impossible to shut down by one operator, beats millisecond improvements with single-point control.</p>\n<h2>RPC and CDN dependencies</h2>\n<p>MetaMask defaults to <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/infura/\">Infura</a>. Reports note that <a href=\"https://www.intelmarketresearch.com/blockchain-nodes-as-a-service-market-23052\">most Web3 applications</a> use Infura, Alchemy, or QuickNode.</p>\n<p>The November 2020 Infura incident demonstrated the consequence: protocol-level resilience became irrelevant when the access layer failed.</p>\n<p>Cloudflare's November 2025 outage revealed how much &#8220;decentralized finance&#8221; depends on one corporation's CDN. Ethereum processed blocks normally, but users could not reach front-ends, explorers, or dashboards.</p>\n<p>Resilient alternatives include wallets that default to multiple RPCs, local light clients, distributed storage on IPFS or Arweave, ENS addressing, and multi-CDN deployments.</p>\n<p>However, these impose costs, such as increased complexity, greater bandwidth requirements, and more complex management.</p>\n<p>Most projects choose convenience, which is why the efficiency trade-off matters. Ethereum's base layer provides survival properties, while the ecosystem mostly wraps them in dependencies that reintroduce every fragility.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_513702\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-513702\" style=\"width: 2220px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"wp-image-513702 size-full\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_goyJdJ3Kmr.jpg\" alt=\"RWA market size deployed on Ethereum\" width=\"2220\" height=\"320\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_goyJdJ3Kmr.jpg 2220w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_goyJdJ3Kmr-300x43.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_goyJdJ3Kmr-1024x148.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_goyJdJ3Kmr-768x111.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_goyJdJ3Kmr-1536x221.jpg 1536w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/brave_goyJdJ3Kmr-2048x295.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2220px) 100vw, 2220px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-513702\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Stacked area chart showing growth of real-world asset tokenization on Ethereum from January 2025 to January 2026, surpassing $12 billion. Image: rwa.xyz</figcaption></figure>\n<h2>The actual trade-off</h2>\n<p>Ethereum's value proposition, as Buterin frames it, is not faster, cheaper, or more convenient. It is working when everything else breaks.</p>\n<p>That requires infrastructure choices prioritizing survival over optimization: multiple client implementations when one is technically superior, diverse RPC providers when one offers better latency, decentralized sequencers when centralized operators deliver faster confirmations, and distributed front-ends when centralized hosting is simpler.</p>\n<p>The industry has not embraced this trade-off. Rollups optimize for UX and accept the risk of a single sequencer. Applications default to convenient RPCs and accept concentration risk. Front-ends are deployed on commercial CDNs and tolerate single-vendor failures.</p>\n<p>The choice: build for the case where Cloudflare, Infura, and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinbase/\">Coinbase</a> all keep operating, or build for when they don't.</p>\n<p>Ethereum's base layer enables the second choice. The surrounding ecosystem overwhelmingly makes the first.</p>\n<p>The protocol providesa 2,000-millisecond latency that persists through infrastructure failures, deplatforming, and geopolitical disruption.</p>\n<p>Whether anyone builds systems that actually leverage that property rather than wrapping it in dependencies that reintroduce every fragility Ethereum was designed to eliminate determines whether resilience becomes real or remains theoretical.</p>\n<p>Blockspace is abundant. Decentralized, permissionless, resilient blockspace is not.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-secures-74b-yet-a-single-web2-switch-can-still-cut-your-access-in-minutes/\">Ethereum isn’t chasing 5.3% yield, Vitalik says &#8211; but the outage risk is over 5× bigger than regulation shocks</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>\n",

The problem is that Japan isn’t just another country’s bond market. Japan has been a pillar holding up the whole global price of money.</p>\n<p>When that pillar shifts, the vibrations travel, and Bitcoin is now wired into the same global risk system as everything else.</p>\n<h2>The Japan shift that matters for crypto</h2>\n<p>Japan is exiting an era that shaped a generation of markets, cheap funding, abundant central bank liquidity, and a sense that rates would stay pinned forever.</p>\n<p>The Bank of Japan has moved its short-term policy rate up to <a href=\"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/\">0.75%</a>, with officials publicly signalling they can keep tightening if the economy and prices track their forecasts.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/boj-keep-raising-interest-rates-governor-ueda-says-2026-01-05/\">Reuters</a> reported Governor Kazuo Ueda reiterated that path this week, and the BOJ itself lists its next meeting for <a href=\"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/\">January 22 to 23</a>, a date that will matter far beyond Tokyo.</p>\n<p>The bigger tell is liquidity.</p>\n<p>Japan’s monetary base, a simple way to see how much BOJ cash is sloshing around, fell <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/japans-cash-circulation-falls-first-time-18-years-2025-boj-stimulus-exit-2026-01-06/\">4.9% year on year in 2025</a>, with December down 9.8% to about ¥594.19 trillion, the first dip below ¥600 trillion since 2020. <span style=\"color: #333333;\">The BOJ publishes the underlying series and releases it under the </span><a href=\"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/statistics/boj/other/mb/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Monetary Base</a><span style=\"color: #333333;\">.</span></p>\n<p>You can think of this as Japan stepping away from its role as the world’s most reliable supplier of cheap liquidity.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin cares about that role, even when the daily correlation looks messy.</p>\n<h2>The way Japan hits Bitcoin, the plumbing first</h2>\n<p>Crypto narratives usually travel fast, inflation hedge, digital gold, store of value, rebel asset. The market plumbing travels faster.</p>\n<p>There are three routes Japan’s rising long yields can hit Bitcoin. None requires a Japan-specific crypto story. They require Bitcoin to behave like a liquid, global risk asset in a world where leverage is everywhere.</p>\n<h3>The yen funding channel, carry trades unwind, leverage gets cut</h3>\n<p>For years, the yen was a funding currency. Borrow yen cheaply, buy something that yields more, layer on leverage, repeat. When Japanese yields rise, and the yen starts moving the wrong way, that structure gets uncomfortable. Uncomfortable leverage gets reduced.</p>\n<p>The cleanest recent example comes from the <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull90.pdf\">BIS</a>, which studied the market turbulence and the unwind of the carry trade in August 2024. The BIS described how deleveraging and margin pressures amplified volatility, and it also cited a rough ballpark estimate of around <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull90.pdf\">¥40 trillion</a> ($250 billion) tied to the episode.</p>\n<p>You do not need to believe a precise number. The point is the mechanism; when yen-linked trades unwind, they can yank on multiple asset classes at once.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin is part of that ecosystem now. A big chunk of BTC volume is derivatives, leverage is baked into the market structure, and the asset trades twenty-four-seven. When macro desks de-risk, crypto is often on the list because it can be sold immediately.</p>\n<h3>The term premium channel, higher long rates raise the global price of risk</h3>\n<p>Japan’s move also matters because it can nudge global term premia, and because Japanese institutions are major holders of foreign assets. If domestic yields become competitive, the incentive to hold foreign duration changes at the margin.</p>\n<p>You can see the global context in the United States, where the 30-year Treasury yield remains elevated.</p>\n<p>Higher long-end yields tighten financial conditions. That tends to pressure assets that depend on abundant liquidity, easy leverage, and optimistic discount rates. Bitcoin often sits in that bucket during tightening phases, even if the story people tell themselves is about something else.</p>\n<p>The IMF has been explicit about the vulnerability here. Its <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/publications/gfsr/issues/2025/10/14/global-financial-stability-report-october-2025\">Global Financial Stability Report</a> flagged the mix of stretched valuations, rising pressure in sovereign bond markets, and the growing role of nonbank financial institutions. When long-end sovereign markets wobble, the stress can travel through funds, margin, and collateral.</p>\n<h3>The fiscal trust channel, bonds wobble, the Bitcoin story gets louder</h3>\n<p>There is a second-order effect that can support Bitcoin, and it starts from a different emotion, trust.</p>\n<p>When long-dated government yields surge, markets start talking about fiscal sustainability, debt servicing costs, and who will buy the supply. The <a href=\"https://www.invesco.com/apac/en/institutional/insights/market-outlook/why-Japanese-bond-yields-are-rising-and-the-yen-is-falling.html\">Invesco</a> note on Japan’s rising yields frames the move through fiscal concerns and shifting market dynamics, with the BOJ’s changing footprint in the bond market sitting in the background.</p>\n<p>That kind of conversation can pull some investors toward Bitcoin over time, especially the cohort that already views sovereign debt as a slow-motion problem. The timing is the hard part. In the short run, a disorderly bond move usually hits risk appetite first, and narrative second.</p>\n<h2>The near-term setup, three paths from here</h2>\n<p>If you want to understand what Japan’s 3.5% long end means for Bitcoin, the cleanest approach is to think in scenarios, then watch for signals.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/150b-wiped-bitcoin-drops-below-87k-on-japan-yield-shock/\" class=\"cs-article-embed__link\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bitcoin-down-december--1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"$150B wiped: Bitcoin drops below $87k on Japan yield shock\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"cs-article-embed__body\">\n            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__related-reading\">Related Reading</span>\n            <h3 class=\"cs-article-embed__title\">$150B wiped: Bitcoin drops below $87k on Japan yield shock</h3>\n                            <p class=\"cs-article-embed__summary\">Thin order books met hard macro triggers and the market snapped as it entered December.</p>\n                                        <div class=\"cs-article-embed__meta\">\n                                            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Dec 1, 2025</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-divider\">&middot;</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Oluwapelumi Adejumo</span>\n                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n<h3>Scenario one, the calm grind</h3>\n<p>Yields keep rising, auctions clear, the yen stays relatively stable, and the BOJ keeps communicating a gradual exit. This can still be a headwind for Bitcoin, mostly through the slow tightening of global financial conditions, and the steady reminder that the era of free money is gone.</p>\n<p>In this world, BTC can still rally, crypto can always find its own catalyst, but the macro wind is in your face.</p>\n<h3>Scenario two, the messy spike.</h3>\n<p>Long-end yields jump sharply, demand looks shaky, the yen strengthens quickly, and volatility pops across markets. This is the scenario where the yen funding channel bites hardest.</p>\n<p>The BIS story from <a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bisbull90.pdf\">August 2024</a> is the template. Deleveraging plus margin plus cross asset positioning can create fast cascades. Bitcoin tends to suffer here because it is liquid and it trades around the clock. It also tends to show the stress early because it has no closing bell.</p>\n<h3>Scenario three, the BOJ flinches</h3>\n<p>If yields rise too quickly the BOJ could shift its posture, slow the normalization, or find ways to stabilise the long end. This would matter because it would be read as a liquidity-relief signal, and markets trade on expectations.</p>\n<p>The trigger for this scenario is not a <span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\">Bitcoin headline; the BOJ’s reaction function, the language, the pace of balance sheet runoff, and how officials talk about financial conditions matter into the <a href=\"https://www.boj.or.jp/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">January 22 to 23</a> meeting</span>.</p>\n<h2>The simple dashboard, if you want to track this like a crypto trade</h2>\n<p>You do not need a PhD in rates to watch the right variables.</p>\n<p>Start with the yen and the long end, then add a flow gauge.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>USD/JPY moves</strong>, a rapid yen rally is a warning sign for carry stress, Reuters has been tracking the yen around <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/boj-keep-raising-interest-rates-governor-ueda-says-2026-01-05/\">157 per dollar</a> as markets price tightening risk.</li>\n<li><strong>Japan 30-year yield</strong>, follow it on <a href=\"https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/bond/tmbmkjp-30y?countrycode=bx\">MarketWatch</a> or <a href=\"https://uk.investing.com/rates-bonds/japan-30-year-bond-yield\">Investing.com</a>.</li>\n<li><span style=\"box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;\"><strong>Japan's cross-border securities flows</strong>, the Ministry of Finance publishes weekly data under <a href=\"https://www.mof.go.jp/english/policy/international_policy/reference/itn_transactions_in_securities/index.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">International Transactions in Securities</a>, which is one of the best real-time windows into whether Japan is buying foreign assets or pulling money home.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If those three start moving together, yen up, long end yields up, repatriation flows up, you should assume global risk is about to feel it, and Bitcoin will be in the blast radius.</p>\n<h2>The Bitcoin angle that keeps surprising people</h2>\n<p>One more twist here.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin does not always react to macro news in the clean way people expect. In 2023, the New York Fed’s paper <a href=\"https://www.newyorkfed.org/research/staff_reports/sr1052\">The Bitcoin Macro Disconnect</a> found that, at intraday horizons, Bitcoin can look strangely “orthogonal” to standard macroeconomic news surprises.</p>\n<p>That matters because it keeps traders overconfident, they see a rate move, Bitcoin does not flinch, they assume the macro channel is broken.</p>\n<p>Then volatility arrives through positioning, leverage, and collateral, and the move shows up all at once.</p>\n<p>Japan’s 3.5% long end is a reminder that the world is changing beneath the surface. Japan is stepping away from zero, the BOJ is shrinking its footprint, liquidity is draining in the data, and bond yields are forcing fiscal conversations back into daylight.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin sits downstream of all of it.</p>\n<p>The next time you see a Japanese bond chart, treat it like weather. You do not need to know every detail of how it forms, you just need to know when a storm is building, and whether you are carrying too much leverage when it hits.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-faces-a-liquidity-drain-danger-zone-as-japans-30-year-yield-breaks-a-historic-record/\">Bitcoin faces a &#8220;liquidity drain&#8221; danger zone as Japan’s 30-year yield breaks a historic record</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>\n",

      "content": "<p>Bitcoin feels like a room full of people holding their breath.</p>\n<p>On paper, the ingredients are there. Spot ETFs are pulling attention back to Bitcoin, big daily flow numbers are again hitting the tape, and macro risk appetite is alive.</p>\n<p>Yet the chart looks like it is waiting for permission.</p>\n<p>Bitcoin was around $93,822 on Jan. 6, and the candles have had that “quiet but tense” look that drives everyone a little mad.</p>\n<p>If you have been around this market long enough, you know the emotional rhythm.</p>\n<p>When Bitcoin is loud, it is obvious. When it is quiet, everyone starts writing their own story onto the silence.</p>\n<p>Maybe buyers are gone. Maybe sellers are gone. Maybe the next move is imminent. Maybe it never comes. The problem with most explanations is they treat quiet as a mystery. It is easier to understand it as plumbing. The market is getting better at swallowing flows</p>\n<p>Start with the simplest question, if ETFs are here, why does Bitcoin not trend more?</p>\n<p>Some days the flows look like they should matter. On Dec. 31, U.S. spot Bitcoin ETFs showed a daily total of about -$348.1 million.</p>\n<p>Two trading days later, Jan. 2 printed about +$471.3 million, then Jan. 5 printed about +$697.2 million. Those are big numbers, and they arrived fast, according to <a href=\"https://farside.co.uk/btc/\">Farside</a>.</p>\n<p>The longer view looks even bigger. Farside’s running totals show IBIT at about +$62.752 billion since launch, while GBTC sits around -$25.239 billion.</p>\n<p>That puts the aggregate net at roughly +$57.763 billion across the listed products.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-turned-less-volatile-than-nvidia-as-institutional-rails-absorbed-570-billion-in-swings-during-a-boring-year/\" class=\"cs-article-embed__link\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bitcoin-volatility-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Bitcoin is now less volatile than Nvidia, a statistical anomaly that completely changes your risk calculation\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"cs-article-embed__body\">\n            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__related-reading\">Related Reading</span>\n            <h3 class=\"cs-article-embed__title\">Bitcoin is now less volatile than Nvidia, a statistical anomaly that completely changes your risk calculation</h3>\n                            <p class=\"cs-article-embed__summary\">Daily volatility hit an all-time low of 2.24% as ETFs, corporate treasuries, and long-term holder redistribution transformed Bitcoin&#039;s market structure, making the asset less speculative, not less active.</p>\n                                        <div class=\"cs-article-embed__meta\">\n                                            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Jan 3, 2026</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-divider\">&middot;</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Gino Matos</span>\n                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n<p>So why does the chart still feel pinned?</p>\n<p>Because a lot of the ETF “demand” is structured demand, and structured demand behaves differently than a crowd of unhedged buyers hitting spot.</p>\n<p>ETFs are a wrapper. They are a pipeline with rules. They pull in creations, they push out redemptions, and they invite authorized participants and market makers to do what they do best. They arbitrage the wrapper against the underlying exposure.</p>\n<p>Once that machine is humming, a chunk of the flow is paired with hedges elsewhere. When that happens, the tape can look calm even while the ecosystem is busy.</p>\n<p>The clean way to say it is this, flows can be big and still land in a market that is prepared for them.</p>\n<h2>Leverage is high, the “direction” is softer than it looks</h2>\n<p>If you want to understand why Bitcoin can feel tight, you have to stop thinking about spot as the whole market.</p>\n<p>Right now, open interest is heavily concentrated in perpetuals.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://coinalyze.net/bitcoin/open-interest/\">Coinalyze OI</a>, Bitcoin aggregated open interest was around $30.4 billion in the snapshot, with about $28.5 billion in perpetual contracts and about $1.9 billion in dated futures.</p>\n<p>That matters because perps are where the market can absorb, offset, and recycle exposure at high speed. A perpetual is frictionless compared with moving large spot size around, and it is easier to neutralize quickly.</p>\n<p>A tight market with high perp open interest can stay tight when opposing positions are balanced.</p>\n<p>It can also stay tight when market makers can warehouse risk briefly, and when hedges are cheap enough to keep running.</p>\n<p>You can have a lot of leverage sitting there, and still have less net pressure on spot than people assume from the headline number. Even the regulated side shows activity without necessarily guaranteeing a trend.</p>\n<p>Google Finance lists <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/BTCF26%3ACME\">BTCF26</a>, CME’s Jan. 2026 Bitcoin futures contract, with open interest around 19.15K contracts in the latest snapshot.</p>\n<p>This is the part that trips people up.</p>\n<p>They see leverage, they expect fireworks.</p>\n<p>Leverage is a tool.</p>\n<p>It can amplify a move, and it can also cushion a move when it is used to hedge, to fade, and to run basis books.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/this-legendary-197m-bear-just-flipped-long-altcoins-with-high-leverage-but-the-funding-rates-signal-a-dangerous-trap/\" class=\"cs-article-embed__link\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/bitcoin-whale-trader-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Legendary $197M short seller just flipped long altcoins with high leverage, but funding rates signal a dangerous trap\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"cs-article-embed__body\">\n            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__related-reading\">Related Reading</span>\n            <h3 class=\"cs-article-embed__title\">Legendary $197M short seller just flipped long altcoins with high leverage, but funding rates signal a dangerous trap</h3>\n                            <p class=\"cs-article-embed__summary\">While retail fears volatility, this wallet is paying massive carry costs to hold a multi-asset book that requires a specific correlation to survive.</p>\n                                        <div class=\"cs-article-embed__meta\">\n                                            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Dec 30, 2025</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-divider\">&middot;</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Liam &#039;Akiba&#039; Wright</span>\n                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n<h2>Volatility is telling you what the market expects, and it is not screaming “breakout”</h2>\n<p>If you want the market’s own forecast, you watch implied volatility.</p>\n<p>Deribit’s <a href=\"https://www.deribit.com/statistics/BTC/volatility-index\">Deribit DVOL</a>, one of the most watched options-based volatility gauges in crypto, has been hovering in the mid 40s, with a recent read around 43.46. <a href=\"https://coinalyze.net/btcdvol/price-live/\">Coinalyze DVOL</a> also showed about 43.5 in its live listing for BTCDVOL.</p>\n<p>That number is annualized implied volatility, and you can translate it into a simple “what is normal” range.</p>\n<p>At roughly 43.5% annualized, the market is pricing something like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>about a 2.27% one-day, one-standard-deviation move, roughly $2.1K at about $93.8K</li>\n<li>about a 6.02% one-week, one-standard-deviation move, roughly $5.6K</li>\n<li>about a 12.46% one-month, one-standard-deviation move, roughly $11.7K</li>\n</ul>\n<p>That is not a promise. A snapshot of expectations drawn from options pricing is, however, a useful gut check.</p>\n<p>It says the market is prepared for movement, but it is not pricing panic. It is also not pricing a runaway melt-up, either.</p>\n<p>Deribit also publishes context metrics like IV Rank, which helps frame where current implied volatility sits versus the past year. The company’s <a href=\"https://insights.deribit.com/education/iv-rank-and-iv-percentile/\">Deribit IV Education</a> note explains the idea behind IV Rank and IV Percentile, and why traders watch them when they are trying to judge how “cheap” or “rich” volatility is.</p>\n<p>The takeaway is simple.</p>\n<p>When you keep hearing “Bitcoin is about to explode,” and implied volatility stays anchored, you are looking at a market that feels no urgency to pay up for protection or for upside optionality.</p>\n<h2>Why this drives people crazy</h2>\n<p>A compressed market turns everyone into a storyteller. Long-term holders interpret quiet as validation. Bitcoin is acting like an asset that is being held, not traded.</p>\n<p>Active traders interpret quiet as an insult, because they are staring at the same levels, the same failed pushes, and the same slow grind. New entrants interpret quiet as safety, then get surprised when the calm breaks.</p>\n<p>That tension is real.</p>\n<p>It shows up in the way people talk about “breakouts” like they are owed something. Bitcoin is not obligated to perform on anyone’s schedule, and the structure of the market right now makes patience feel like the whole trade.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/why-good-news-hasnt-been-moving-bitcoin-recently-macro-without-the-boom/\" class=\"cs-article-embed__link\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/bitcoin-macro-news-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Why doesn't “good news” move Bitcoin anymore?

Today, a lot of the market’s biggest pipes are designed for hedging and for spread capture. ETF wrappers help create natural arbitrage loops.</p>\n<p>Perps help neutralize exposure quickly.</p>\n<p>Options markets can express views on volatility without demanding a spot move. When those mechanisms line up, the market can recycle shock, return to the mean, and do it with surprising speed. This is also why you can see huge single-day reversals in ETF flows without an immediate structural break.</p>\n<p>Investors pulled record amounts from BlackRock’s IBIT toward the end of 2025 during a broader crypto drawdown, yet the system still functioned.</p>\n<p>The flows moved. The wrappers did what they do. The market digested it.</p>\n<p>A lot of the time, that digestion looks like boredom on a spot chart.</p>\n<h3>Macro context, risk appetite is doing its own thing</h3>\n<p>Bitcoin does not live alone, and the macro backdrop matters most when it changes.</p>\n<p>U.S. equities have been strong. The S&P 500 closed around 6,902.05 on Jan. 5, according to <a href=\"https://stooq.com/q/d/?s=%5Espx\">SPX</a>.</p>\n<p>In those environments, volatility selling and carry-seeking can dominate the tone, and crypto tends to absorb that mood through positioning rather than constant spot chasing. This does not mean Bitcoin is tethered to equities.</p>\n<p>It does mean the broader “risk” complex influences how aggressively people pay for volatility, and how quickly market makers are willing to warehouse inventory.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/oil-prices-just-did-the-unthinkable-after-the-venezuela-raid-and-it-hands-bitcoin-a-rare-advantage/\" class=\"cs-article-embed__link\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/oil-bitcoin-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Oil prices just did the unthinkable after the Venezuela raid, and it hands Bitcoin a rare advantage\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"cs-article-embed__body\">\n            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__related-reading\">Related Reading</span>\n            <h3 class=\"cs-article-embed__title\">Oil prices just did the unthinkable after the Venezuela raid, and it hands Bitcoin a rare advantage</h3>\n                            <p class=\"cs-article-embed__summary\">Everyone expected an oil spike, but the market is actually pricing a long-term supply shock that completely rewrites the liquidity roadmap for crypto.</p>\n                                        <div class=\"cs-article-embed__meta\">\n                                            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Jan 5, 2026</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-divider\">&middot;</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Liam &#039;Akiba&#039; Wright</span>\n                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n<h2>The forward look, what changes the regime</h2>\n<p>A tight market stays tight until the day it doesn’t. The question that matters is what kind of catalyst breaks this particular compression.</p>\n<p>Here are the scenarios that fit the current plumbing.</p>\n<h3><strong>Scenario one, compression continues</strong></h3>\n<p>ETF flows stay choppy, even when they print large positive days.</p>\n<p>Derivatives open interest remains heavy in perps, and implied volatility stays around the mid 40s. In that world, the market keeps recycling exposure. Range traders keep getting paid, trend traders keep getting teased.</p>\n<h3><strong>Scenario two, a cleaner upside trend</strong></h3>\n<p>You would expect a shift in how volatility behaves first.</p>\n<p>Implied volatility starts to rise, and it sticks, because hedging becomes more expensive and because the market starts paying for the possibility of a persistent move. A multiweek stretch of consistent net inflows can do it. So can an environment where market makers step back from warehousing risk.</p>\n<p>The early signal is DVOL lifting before price breaks cleanly.</p>\n<h3><strong>Scenario three, downside volatility arrives via deleveraging</strong></h3>\n<p>This version often starts with some mix of sharp outflows, fast open interest contraction, and stress across perps.</p>\n<p>The market stops absorbing, and starts forcing, and liquidations do the rest. The IBIT outflow day is a reminder that large negative flow shocks exist. The “tight” market can still produce abrupt moves when participants are positioned the wrong way.</p>\n<h3><strong>Scenario four, the false break</strong></h3>\n<p>This is the most emotionally draining path.</p>\n<p>The market pushes out of range, a wave of positioning follows, and then the structure pulls it back, because hedges stay cheap, because liquidity returns, and because flows remain two-sided.</p>\n<p>Big daily inflow prints can appear in this scenario too, because wrapper flow does not guarantee a one-way spot impulse. None of these scenarios depend on a single headline. They depend on whether the market’s internal shock absorbers keep working.</p>\n<h2>The point that makes this story worth telling</h2>\n<p>Bitcoin’s quiet is starting to look less like a riddle, and more like a consequence.</p>\n<p>The market has grown up in ways that flatten the obvious moves. It has more wrappers, more arbitrage, more leverage, and more hedging tools. The same features that make Bitcoin easier to access also make it easier to neutralize.</p>\n<p>That is why the range feels so stubborn.</p>\n<p>The market is busy.</p>\n<p>It is liquid in the places that matter, and it is designed to smooth a lot of what used to become a trend. At some point, something changes.</p>\n<p>Hedges get expensive, liquidity steps away, flows persist in one direction, and the market’s quiet finally turns into motion.</p>\n<p>Until then, the “breakout” is a story people keep telling themselves, and the plumbing keeps doing its job.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/bitcoin-is-swallowing-billions-in-etf-cash-again-but-a-specific-market-wrapper-is-killing-the-price-breakout/\">Bitcoin is swallowing billions in ETF cash again, but a specific “market wrapper” is killing the price breakout</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>\n",

When Kroll was breached in August 2023, the data of <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/ftx/\">FTX</a>, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/blockfi/\">BlockFi</a>, and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/genesis/\">Genesis</a> creditors was accessed.</p>\n<p>Lawsuits allege the mishandling led to daily phishing emails spoofing claims portals.</p>\n<p>The pattern is consistent: third-party vendors hold &#8220;non-sensitive&#8221; data that becomes sensitive when tied to crypto asset ownership. A shipping address is metadata until attached to a hardware wallet order.</p>\n<p>The commerce layer, consisting of merchant platforms, CRMs, and shipping integrations, creates maps of who owns what and where to find them.</p>\n<p>Ledger's advice is sound: verify domains, ignore urgency, never share your seed. Yet, security researchers suggest expanding this.</p>\n<p>Users with high-value holdings should consider enabling the optional passphrase feature, a 25th word that exists only in memory. Additionally, users should rotate their contact information periodically, use unique email addresses for wallet purchases, and monitor for SIM-swap attempts.</p>\n<p>Address exposure carries offline risk. Delivery minimization, such as mail forwarding, business addresses, and pickup locations, reduces the surface for physical coercion. Wrench attacks remain statistically rare but represent a real and growing threat.</p>\n<p>The Global-e incident raises unanswered questions: How many customers were affected? What specific fields were accessed? Were other Global-e clients compromised? What logs track the intruder's movement?</p>\n<p>The crypto industry needs to rethink the risks of its commerce infrastructure. If self-custody removes trusted third parties from asset control, handing customer data to e-commerce platforms and payment processors creates exploitable maps of targets.</p>\n<p>The hardware wallet might be a fortress, but business operations create persistent vulnerabilities.</p>\n<p>The Global-e breach won't hack a single Ledger device. It doesn't need to. It gave attackers a fresh list of names, addresses, and proof-of-purchase, which is everything required to launch phishing campaigns that will run for years and, in rare cases, enable crimes that don't require bypassing encryption.</p>\n<p>The real vulnerability isn't the secure element. It's the paper trail leading to users' doors.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/new-ledger-breach-didnt-steal-your-crypto-but-it-exposed-the-one-thing-that-leads-criminals-to-your-door/\">Ledger customer data breached including info that leads violent criminals to your door</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>\n",

In the past seven days alone, <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/pepe/\">PEPE</a> and the self-deprecatingly named USELESS token have each surged 54%. MOG climbed 38%, while the <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/\">Solana</a>-based heavyweight BONK added 34%.</p>\n<p>Even legacy assets like <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/dogecoin/\">Dogecoin</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/shiba-inu/\">Shiba Inu</a> have joined the fray, with Shiba Inu jumping 13% on Sunday amid renewed trading frenzy.</p>\n<p>Santiment analysts attributed the timing of the bounce to a classic contrarian signal. The rally began shortly after Christmas, precisely when &#8220;FUD&#8221; (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) about speculative assets reached its peak among retail traders.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_513678\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-513678\" style=\"width: 2560px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"size-full wp-image-513678\" src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9y-UIYX0AAVWhf-scaled.jpg\" alt=\"Memecoins Lead Crypto Market Rebound\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1437\" srcset=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9y-UIYX0AAVWhf-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9y-UIYX0AAVWhf-300x168.jpg 300w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9y-UIYX0AAVWhf-1024x575.jpg 1024w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9y-UIYX0AAVWhf-768x431.jpg 768w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9y-UIYX0AAVWhf-1536x862.jpg 1536w, https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/G9y-UIYX0AAVWhf-2048x1150.jpg 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px\" /><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-513678\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Memecoins Lead Crypto Market Rebound (Source: Santiment)</figcaption></figure>\n<p>As sentiment hit rock bottom and casual traders wrote off the sector, smart money appeared to step in, capitalizing on the capitulation to accumulate positions at discounted valuations.</p>\n<p>For fund managers who spent 2025 shifting allocations toward &#8220;quality&#8221;, the resurgence of the meme sector presents a dilemma.</p>\n<p>The move tests how far the industry is willing to lean back into leverage.

When billions of dollars flow into meme-themed assets, the impact ripples outward.</p>\n<p>It influences listing decisions at major centralized exchanges, which rely on trading fees from high-volume tokens to subsidize other operations. It also exerts pressure on asset managers to broaden their product pipelines.</p>\n<p>If a $50 billion asset class begins to set the cycle's tempo, the industry’s infrastructure is forced to adapt to the liquidity demands of assets once dismissed as ephemeral gags.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the sector is also diversifying internally. CoinGecko data breaks down the $51.6 billion meme economy into distinct sub-sectors, revealing a complex hierarchy.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The Boy’s Club&#8221; (Matt Furie-inspired characters like PEPE) and &#8220;Frog-Themed&#8221; tokens now command 10.9% and 10.7% of the meme market, respectively, challenging the historical dominance of &#8220;Dog-Themed&#8221; coins, which sit at roughly

Pollak described memes as &#8220;coordination points for community&#8221; that bring people together and create a context for collective creation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We need more memecoins because we need more creativity, community, and collective action,&#8221; Pollak said, framing the assets as a top-of-funnel mechanism that onboards users who eventually migrate to other on-chain applications.</p>\n<p>For the blockchain networks themselves, the stakes are tangible. A sustained meme rally drives demand for the network's native token (used to pay gas fees), tests network throughput, and attracts liquidity providers.</p>\n<h2>The centralization paradox</h2>\n<p>Despite the narratives of community and decentralized fun, available data reveal significant risks regarding concentration.</p>\n<p>While the price action suggests a broad-based frenzy, ownership of the top assets remains heavily centralized.</p>\n<p>Santiment <a href=\"https://x.com/santimentfeed/status/2007964007421063400\">data</a> on Shiba Inu, one of the sector's stalwarts, shows that the 10 largest wallets control nearly 63% of the total supply.

      "content": "<p>For years, the institutional playbook for the crypto industry was simple: buy <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/bitcoin/\">Bitcoin</a>, perhaps dabble in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/ethereum/\">Ethereum</a>, and ignore the rest.</p>\n<p>In 2025, that playbook was rewritten.</p>\n<p>While Bitcoin retained its crown as the largest asset by total volume, the real story of the year was a dramatic structural shift in where new capital chose to go.</p>\n<p>According to year-end data from <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/companies/coinshares/\">CoinShares</a>, the era of &#8220;Bitcoin-only&#8221; dominance has given way to a tiered market hierarchy where Ethereum has cemented its status as a core holding, and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/xrp/\">XRP</a> and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/solana/\">Solana</a> have emerged as the first true &#8220;institutional alt majors.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The numbers portray a distinct pivot in investor behavior. While Bitcoin investment products attracted $26.98 billion in inflows for 2025, that figure represented a 35% decline from the record-setting pace of 2024.</p>\n<p>In contrast, capital poured into alternative networks at unprecedented rates.</p>\n<p>Ethereum products saw inflows surge 138%, while XRP and Solana posted growth rates of approximately 500% and 1,000% respectively, effectively doubling their installed asset bases in a single calendar year.</p>\n<p>This divergence signals a maturing market moving away from broad, speculative diversification toward a narrow, concentrated elite.</p>\n<h2>The graduation of Ethereum and the ‘velocity’ of new majors</h2>\n<p>The 2025 data suggests that institutional allocators have fundamentally reclassified Ethereum.</p>\n<p>For years treated as a high-risk satellite to a Bitcoin core, the second-largest cryptocurrency has graduated to the status of a primary portfolio asset.</p>\n<p>CoinShares’ <a href=\"https://researchblog.coinshares.com/digital-asset-fund-flows-2025-report-569f270e1141\">report</a> shows Ethereum drew $12.69 billion in net new money in 2025, up from just $5.33 billion the year prior.</p>\n<p>This 138% year-over-year jump occurred even as Bitcoin flows cooled, indicating that investors are increasingly comfortable holding independent views on the two assets rather than trading them as a correlated pair.</p>\n<p>With total assets under management (AUM) in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-etfs-draw-record-breaking-1-billion-in-a-single-day/\">Ethereum products</a> ending the year at $25.7 billion, the network has achieved a scale that mandates inclusion in diversified digital portfolios.</p>\n<p>However, the most aggressive repricing of risk occurred in the next tier down.</p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/ethereum-etfs-draw-record-breaking-1-billion-in-a-single-day/\" class=\"cs-article-embed__link\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/ethereum-etf-inflow-1-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Ethereum ETFs draw record-breaking $1 billion in a single day\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"cs-article-embed__body\">\n            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__related-reading\">Related Reading</span>\n            <h3 class=\"cs-article-embed__title\">Ethereum ETFs draw record-breaking $1 billion in a single day</h3>\n                            <p class=\"cs-article-embed__summary\">BlackRock leads the way with $640 million as Ethereum attracts growing institutional interest in ETFs.</p>\n                                        <div class=\"cs-article-embed__meta\">\n                                            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Aug 12, 2025</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-divider\">&middot;</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Oluwapelumi Adejumo</span>\n                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n<p>XRP and Solana, long battling for third place in the market hierarchy, experienced <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/how-xrp-etfs-1-billion-inflow-is-shaping-a-new-market-equilibrium/\">an inflow velocity that dwarfed the majors.</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/xrp-etfs-top-1b-but-why-hasnt-price-moved/\">XRP investment products</a> absorbed $3.69 billion in 2025, a roughly five-fold increase from the $608 million seen in 2024. Solana’s ascent was even steeper, attracting $3.56 billion compared to just $310 million a year earlier, a tenfold expansion.</p>\n<p>What makes these figures significant is not just their growth rates, but their scale relative to the existing market.</p>\n<p>At the start of 2025, the investment product ecosystems for XRP and Solana were relatively modest. By year’s end, flows into both assets roughly equaled their total ending assets under management, approximately $3.5 billion each.</p>\n<p>In financial terms, this represents a &#8220;replacement rate&#8221; of nearly 100%. While Bitcoin’s inflows represented about 19% of its total AUM and Ethereum’s accounted for 49%, Solana and XRP effectively turned over their entire cap tables, signaling a massive influx of new institutional holders entering the fray for the first time.</p>\n<h2>The death of the long tail</h2>\n<p>If 2025 was a breakout year for the top tier, it was a sobering reality check for the rest of the market.</p>\n<p>When excluding Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, multi-asset baskets, and short-Bitcoin hedging products, the &#8220;remaining altcoins&#8221; category, which includes established names like <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/cardano/\">Cardano</a>, Litecoin, and <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/coins/chainlink/\">Chainlink</a>, as well as emerging competitors like Sui, saw inflows collapse.</p>\n<p>This basket drew just $318 million in 2025, a 30% drop from $457 million in 2024.</p>\n<p>This contraction points to a significant hardening of the investment landscape. In previous cycles, retail enthusiasm often spilled over into hundreds of smaller tokens, driving broad-based rallies.</p>\n<p>The ETF and ETP (Exchange Traded Product) era appears to be functioning differently. Regulatory moats and liquidity requirements create high barriers to entry for new financial products.</p>\n<p>So, asset managers are hesitant to launch products for tokens that lack regulatory clarity or deep liquidity.

As capital coalesces around the four assets that have established liquid, regulated investment vehicles, the liquidity gap between the &#8220;majors&#8221; and the &#8220;minors&#8221; widens.</p>\n<p>This creates a self-reinforcing cycle: because Solana and XRP have the liquidity and products, they attract flows; because they attract flows, their liquidity deepens further, making them even safer for the next wave of institutional entrants.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, assets outside this privileged circle face a liquidity drought, struggling to attract the passive flows that now drive a significant portion of crypto market appreciation.</p>\n<h2>The model portfolio for 2026</h2>\n<p>The crystallization of this hierarchy has profound implications for how digital asset portfolios will be constructed in 2026 and beyond.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;Bitcoin-only&#8221; maximalist strategy, while still defensible as a conservative approach, is losing market share to multi-sleeve models.</p>\n<p>Financial advisors and wealth managers, who previously struggled to justify exposure beyond Bitcoin, now have data to support a diversified core.</p>\n<p>The new standard model appears to be shifting toward a weighted basket: Bitcoin as the digital commodity and anchor; <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/vitalik-buterin-declares-ethereum-has-solved-cryptos-biggest-problem-yet-his-2030-roadmap-exposes-a-massive-ideological-risk/\">Ethereum as the foundational smart contract layer</a>; and Solana and XRP as high-growth &#8220;satellites&#8221; representing specific bets on speed, scalability, and payments utility.</p>\n<p>The CoinShares data supports this view, showing that while Bitcoin is becoming a lower-beta asset, stable, massive, but slower-growing, the alpha is being sought in these newly minted majors.</p>\n<p>Notably, the presence of $105 million in <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/the-big-bitcoin-short-who-shorted-btc-before-trumps-tariff-post-to-bank-200-million/\">short-Bitcoin product</a> inflows and a total AUM of $139 million in that category further suggests a maturation in how these tools are used.</p>\n<p>It shows that institutions are not just blindly accumulating; they are hedging.</p>\n<p>The ability to short the market leader while going long on high-beta satellites allows for sophisticated relative-value trades that were previously the domain of crypto-native hedge funds, not regulated asset managers.</p>\n<h2>The risks of a narrow market</h2>\n<p>While the minting of new majors is a sign of maturity, it introduces new risks.</p>\n<p>The concentration of flows into just four assets means the health of the entire ecosystem is increasingly dependent on the performance of a few networks.</p>\n<p>The &#8220;velocity&#8221; seen in Solana and XRP, where inflows matched total AUM, is a double-edged sword. Such rapid expansion implies that a significant portion of the holder base is new.</p>\n<p>Unlike Bitcoin’s entrenched base of &#8220;hodlers&#8221; who have weathered multiple 80% drawdowns, these new institutional entrants may be more price-sensitive. If the narrative shifts or <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/sec-transparency-questioned-after-gary-genslers-texts-vanish/\">regulatory headwinds</a> re-emerge, the same standardized products that drove money in could facilitate a rapid exit.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the starvation of the long tail <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-index-etfs-will-dominate-2026-because-wealth-managers-can-no-longer-handle-a-specific-due-diligence-burden/\">raises questions about innovation.</a></p>\n\n<div class=\"cs-article-embed\">\n    <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/crypto-index-etfs-will-dominate-2026-because-wealth-managers-can-no-longer-handle-a-specific-due-diligence-burden/\" class=\"cs-article-embed__link\">\n                    <div class=\"cs-article-embed__media\">\n                <img src=\"https://cryptoslate.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/crypto-index-etf-1024x538.jpg\" alt=\"Crypto index ETFs will dominate 2026 because the SEC is about to break the single-asset model\" loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\">\n            </div>\n                <div class=\"cs-article-embed__body\">\n            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__related-reading\">Related Reading</span>\n            <h3 class=\"cs-article-embed__title\">Crypto index ETFs will dominate 2026 because the SEC is about to break the single-asset model</h3>\n                            <p class=\"cs-article-embed__summary\">In 2026, the shift to crypto index ETFs may redefine asset allocation and investor interest dynamics.</p>\n                                        <div class=\"cs-article-embed__meta\">\n                                            <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Dec 19, 2025</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-divider\">&middot;</span>\n                                                                <span class=\"cs-article-embed__meta-item\">Oluwapelumi Adejumo</span>\n                                    </div>\n                    </div>\n    </a>\n</div>\n\n<p>If capital is systematically funneled only to the largest incumbents, new protocols may struggle to achieve the valuation velocity needed to attract talent and secure networks.</p>\n<p>The industry risks becoming top-heavy, with trillions of dollars in value anchored to four chains while the broader ecosystem stagnates.</p>\n<p>The post <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com/xrp-and-solana-dethrone-bitcoin-and-ethereum-as-institutional-favorites-in-2025/\">XRP and Solana dethrone Bitcoin and Ethereum as institutional favorites in 2025</a> appeared first on <a href=\"https://cryptoslate.com\">CryptoSlate</a>.</p>\n",
