New global punctuality rankings from aviation analytics firm Cirium show just how dire delays were in 2025.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cirium analyzes flight data from more than 600 sources including airlines, airports, global distribution systems, and civil aviation authorities. A flight is considered on time if it lands within 15 minutes of its scheduled gate arrival time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aeromexico earned the top spot for global airlines for the second year in a row with 90.02% of its flights arriving on time, improving by over 3% from the previous year. The win comes after the airline <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/apollo-backed-grupo-aeromexico-valued-28-billion-open-nyse-debut-2025-11-06/\">debuted</a> at $2.8 billion on the NYSE last year and raised $222.8 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Maintaining consistent on-time performance requires sophisticated network planning, operational coordination, and the ability to recover quickly when irregularities occur,” Cirium CEO Jeremy Bowen said in a statement. “These results reflect the operational discipline that defines aviation’s top performers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saudia followed in second with 85.63% on-time, and the Scandinavian airline SAS claimed third with 86.09%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Delta is the only American company to make the top 10 and has the highest rating of all American airlines. “Delta’s fifth consecutive North American win reflects sustained operational focus that separates industry leaders from competitors,” Bowen said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The airline — which flies more than three times the number of flights as any other airline in the top 10 — sank in the rankings after placing third last year. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Timeliness improvements from Azul Brazilian Airlines, Spain’s Iberia, and Qatar Airways helped raise their ratings and beat out the Atlanta-based airline.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how the most on-time airlines placed, according to Cirium’s analysis.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top 10 Most On-Time Global Airlines</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Aeromexico: 90.02% on-time arrivals</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Saudia: 86.53%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Scandinavian Airlines: 86.09%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Azul Brazilian Airlines: 85.18%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Qatar Airways: 84.42%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Iberia: 83.52%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>LATAM Airlines: 82.40%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Avianca: 81.73%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Turkish Airlines: 81.41%</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Delta Air Lines: 80.90%</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/these-are-the-10-most-on-time-airlines-in-the-world-and-only-one-american-company-made-the-cut/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "title": "AI layoffs are looking more and more like corporate fiction that’s masking a darker reality, Oxford Economics suggests",
      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/ai-layoffs-convenient-corporate-fiction-true-false-oxford-economics-productivity/",
      "content": "\n<p>Despite breathless headlines warning of a robot takeover in the workforce, a new research briefing from Oxford Economics casts doubt on the narrative that artificial intelligence is currently causing mass unemployment. According to the firm’s analysis, &#8220;firms don&#8217;t appear to be replacing workers with AI on a significant scale,&#8221; suggesting instead that companies may be using the technology as a cover for routine headcount reductions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a January 7 report, the research firm argued that, while anecdotal evidence of job displacement exists, the macroeconomic data does not support the idea of a structural shift in employment caused by automation. Instead, it points to a more cynical corporate strategy: &#8220;We suspect some firms are trying to dress up layoffs as a good news story rather than bad news, such as past over-hiring.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Spinning the narrative</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary motivation for this rebranding of job cuts appears to be investor relations. The report notes that attributing staff reductions to AI adoption &#8220;conveys a more positive message to investors&#8221; than admitting to traditional business failures, such as weak consumer demand or &#8220;excessive hiring in the past.&#8221; By framing layoffs as a technological pivot, companies can present themselves as forward-thinking innovators rather than businesses struggling with cyclical downturns.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a recent interview, Wharton management professor <a href=\"https://mgmt.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/cappelli/\">Peter Cappelli</a> told <em>Fortune</em> that he&#8217;s seen research about how, because markets typically celebrate news of job cuts, firms announce <a href=\"https://www.elibrary.imf.org/view/journals/001/2016/255/article-A001-en.xml#:~:text=Moreover%2C%20when%20we%20compare%20the,driver%20of%20firms'%20layoff%20policies.\">&#8220;phantom layoffs&#8221;</a> that never actually occur. Companies were arbitraging the positive stock-market reaction to the news of a potential layoff, but &#8220;a few decades ago, the market stopped going up because [investors] started to realize that companies were not actually even doing the layoffs that they said they were going to do.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked about the supposed link between AI and layoffs, Cappelli urged people to look closely at announcements. &#8220;The headline is, &#8216;It&#8217;s because of AI,&#8217; but if you read what they actually say, they say, &#8216;We expect that AI will cover this work.&#8217; Hadn&#8217;t done it. They&#8217;re just hoping. And they&#8217;re saying it because that&#8217;s what they think investors want to hear.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Data behind the hype</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Oxford report highlighted data from Challenger, Gray &amp; Christmas, the recruiting firm that is one of the leading providers of layoff data, to illustrate the disparity between perception and reality. While AI was cited as the reason for nearly 55,000 U.S. job cuts in the first 11 months of 2025—accounting for over 75% of all AI-related cuts reported since 2023—this figure represents a mere 4.5% of total reported job losses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, job losses attributed to standard &#8220;market and economic conditions&#8221; were four times larger, totaling 245,000. When viewed against the broader backdrop of the U.S. labor market, where 1.5 million to 1.8 million workers lose their jobs in any given month, &#8220;AI-related job losses are still relatively limited.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The productivity puzzle</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Oxford posits a simple economic litmus test for the AI revolution: if machines were truly replacing humans at scale, output per remaining worker should skyrocket. &#8220;If AI were already replacing labour at scale, productivity growth should be accelerating. Generally, it isn&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The report observes that recent productivity growth has actually decelerated, a trend that aligns with cyclical economic behaviors rather than an AI-driven boom. While the firm acknowledges that productivity gains from new technologies often take years to materialize, the current data suggests that AI use remains &#8220;experimental in nature and isn&#8217;t yet replacing workers on a major scale.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the same time, recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics confirms that the &#8220;low-hire, low-fire&#8221; labor market is morphing into a &#8220;jobless expansion,&#8221; <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/kpmg/\" target=\"_blank\">KPMG</a> chief economist Diane Swonk previously told <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/jobless-expansion-low-hire-fire-economy-k-shaped-december-november-data-jolts-reaction/\"><em>Fortune</em>&#8216;s Eva Roytburg</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This tallies with what <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/bank-of-america-corp/\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America</a> Research&#8217;s Head of US Equity &amp; Quantitative Strategy, Savita Subramanian, told <em>Fortune</em> in August about how companies have learned in the 2020s to generally replace people with process. At the same time, she agreed that productivity measures &#8220;haven&#8217;t really improved all that much since 2001,&#8221; recalling the famous “productivity paradox” identified by Nobel prize-winning economist <a href=\"https://www.richmondfed.org/publications/research/economic_brief/2024/eb_24-25\">Robert Solow</a>: “You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The briefing also addresses fears that AI is eroding entry-level white-collar jobs. While U.S. graduate unemployment rose to a peak of 5.5% in March 2025, Oxford Economics argued this is likely &#8220;cyclical rather than structural,&#8221; pointing to a &#8220;supply glut&#8221; of degree-holders as a more probable culprit. The share of 22-to-27-year-olds with university education in the U.S. rose to 35% by 2019, with even sharper increases observed in the Eurozone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Oxford Economics concludes that shifts in the labor market are likely to be &#8220;evolutionary rather than revolutionary.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/ai-layoffs-convenient-corporate-fiction-true-false-oxford-economics-productivity/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>President Donald Trump said his administration will move to bar large Wall Street investors from buying up single-family homes, framing the effort as a bid to restore access to homeownership for ordinary families priced out of the market. In a <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115855059527504524\">Truth Social post</a>, he warned the “American Dream is increasingly out of reach for far too many people, especially younger Americans,” and vowed to stop big investors from buying the proverbial house next door.​</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump said the federal government will move to&nbsp;ban&nbsp;institutional investors and major Wall Street firms from purchasing single-family homes, a segment that has become a lucrative asset class for large landlords and private equity. He cast the initiative as a turning point in housing policy, arguing “people live in homes, not corporations” and families should not have to bid against “billion-dollar funds” for starter houses.<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/trump-to-target-institutional-purchases-of-single-family-homes\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>​</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his post, Trump linked the squeeze on homebuyers to what he claimed was “record high inflation” under President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress, saying the cost surge has left many young Americans locked out of ownership. &#8220;For a very long time, buying and owning a home was considered the pinnacle of the American Dream. It was the reward for working hard, and doing the right thing.&#8221; The housing market has come to a near standstill in the last several years following a boom during the pandemic, when prices doubled in most markets as people reordered their social lives amid the remote work and social distancing era.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sean Dobson, CEO of The Amherst Group, one of America&#8217;s top institutional landlords, said in a statement to <em>Fortune</em> that it&#8217;s simply &#8220;inaccurate&#8221; to blame institutional ownership for the affordability problems in the housing market, as it &#8220;gets both the problem and the solution wrong.&#8221; He said America’s current housing crisis stems from &#8220;years of policy failure, not the families who rent or the capital that houses them.&#8221; He pointed out that Amherst serves over 200,000 residents, nearly 85% of whom wouldn&#8217;t qualify to buy the homes they live in today. Trump&#8217;s potential ban, if realized, would be &#8220;unacceptable&#8221; as it would put institutional rental housing and threaten real families. &#8220;Our industry is not the cause of the housing crisis, it is part of the solution.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"house-next-door-message\">&#8216;House next door&#8217; message</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s message zeroed in on the symbolism of investors acquiring properties in residential neighborhoods, promising to stop Wall Street from buying the house next door and turning it into an investment vehicle. Housing advocates and some local officials have warned bulk purchases by institutional buyers can drain the supply of for-sale homes and push families into a permanent renter status.<a href=\"https://dc.urbanturf.com/articles/blog/trump_administration_moves_to_ban_institutional_investors_from_single-famil/24197\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a>​</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president’s post echoed this criticism, arguing large-scale buying crowds out first-time buyers and pushes prices beyond what middle-class incomes can afford. ​</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has not yet released draft legislation or an executive order, but officials and outside analysts say the administration is exploring several avenues, including outright purchase bans for institutional buyers and stricter limits on how many single-family homes a large investor can own. Any such move would likely focus on firms above certain asset or ownership thresholds, rather than mom-and-pop landlords or small local investors.<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.barrons.com/articles/trump-ban-institutional-investors-buying-single-family-homes-blackstone-stock-drops-25c85458\"></a>​</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president said he would flesh out the plan later this month, including at the World Economic Forum meeting in Davos, where housing affordability is expected to feature in his speech. ​</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shares of single-family rental real estate investment trusts and housing-focused private equity firms slid after Trump’s comments, as investors weighed the risk of future curbs on their ability to grow portfolios. Analysts noted some of the largest players collectively own hundreds of thousands of houses, making them particularly vulnerable to any federal ownership cap or purchase prohibition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/housing/trump-housing-large-investor-single-family-home-ban-13e06f61\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"></a><em>​[This report has been updated to include a statement from Amherst CEO Sean Dobson.]</em></p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/trump-to-ban-wall-street-from-buying-house-next-door-american-dream-out-of-reach/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>As the United States enters 2026, the national mood regarding the country’s balance sheet is sour. Following a tumultuous 2025, marked by historic government shutdowns and record spending, a new report indicates that the vast majority of the electorate is demanding immediate legislative attention to the nation&#8217;s financial health—and, in particular, its $38 trillion national debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>According to the January 2026 index sponsored by the nonpartisan Peter G.&nbsp;Peterson&nbsp;Foundation, released Wednesday, 82% of voters agree that lawmakers must spend more time addressing the national debt. The index is 51 (with 100 being neutral), six points lower than January 2025 — indicating that voters want to address the unsustainable national debt and budget outlook. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sharp decline in confidence follows a year of unprecedented fiscal turbulence. The foundation notes that 2025 witnessed the &#8220;longest government shutdown in history,&#8221; the &#8220;most expensive reconciliation bill,&#8221; and the &#8220;highest interest costs ever.&#8221; These events appear to have crystallized voter opinion, pushing the debt crisis to the forefront of the national conversation as the 2026 election cycle begins.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>&#8216;Understandably concerned</strong>&#8216;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Michael A. Peterson, CEO of the Peterson Foundation, linked the public&#8217;s anxiety directly to economic consequences that hit voters&#8217; wallets.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As the new year begins, voters are understandably concerned about America’s fiscal direction,&#8221; Peterson said. &#8220;The rapidly rising debt puts upward pressure on inflation and interest rates, driving up the cost of living and harming economic growth.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Peterson emphasized that the issue is unavoidable for those seeking office in the upcoming midterm elections. &#8220;Looking ahead to this election year, it will be critically important for candidates to engage voters on solutions that will help stabilize the debt and build a stronger, more prosperous 2026 and beyond,&#8221; he stated.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Bipartisan consensus on debt priority</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite a polarized political climate, the desire for fiscal restraint appears to be one of the few issues bridging the partisan divide. The survey reveals that 79% of voters believe reducing the debt should be a &#8220;top-three priority&#8221; for both the president and Congress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When broken down by party affiliation, the data shows broad, cross-party alignment on the urgency of the issue:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• 89% of Republicans view debt reduction as a top priority.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• 75% of Democrats share this view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• 70% of independents agree.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Fiscal Confidence Index</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The Index is composed of three equally weighted categories: Concern, Priority, and Expectations. The December 2025 breakdown highlights the severity of voter sentiment across all three metrics:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Concern (Score: 49): This indicates &#8220;deep concern&#8221; about the direction of the national debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Priority (Score: 22): This exceptionally low score indicates that Americans feel elected leaders are not currently prioritizing the debt enough and want them to make addressing long-term debt a &#8220;high priority&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>• Expectations (Score: 80): Voters remain pessimistic about whether the debt situation will get better or worse over the next few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey was commissioned by the Peter G. Peterson Foundation and conducted by the Democratic firm Global Strategy Group and the Republican firm North Star Opinion Research. The poll surveyed 1,004 registered voters nationwide between December 15 and December 17, 2025, carrying a margin of error of +/- 3.1%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>For this story,&nbsp;</em>Fortune<em>&nbsp;journalists used generative AI as a research tool.

      "content": "\n<p>When President Donald Trump entered his second term, he renewed his 2019 vow to take over Greenland. But what started as a seemingly quixotic proposal to purchase the Arctic island has now morphed into an unprecedented threat against a NATO ally—one that experts told <em>Fortune</em> could cost hundreds of billions of dollars, destroy the Western alliance, and yield minimal economic benefit for decades.&nbsp;<br><br>Days after invading Venezuela to capture President Nicolas Maduro, Trump <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/venezuela-raid-greenland-minerals-arctic-china-russia-denmark-nato/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks\">doubled down</a> on his proposed plans for the small arctic nation, declaring yesterday that &#8220;we need Greenland from a national security situation.&#8221; Accomplishing this goal, the White House now says, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/01/08/trump-using-military-force-take-over-greenland-panama-canal/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks\">could include</a> using the U.S. military.&nbsp;<br><br><em>Fortune</em> contacted the White House for comment.<br><br>&#8220;People need to understand that he is serious. He wants Greenland to be a part of the United States,&#8221; Alexander Gray, who served in Trump&#8217;s first administration and testified before the Senate on Greenland acquisition mechanisms, told <em>Fortune</em>. &#8220;How that happens is subject to discussion, but the overall aim is not changing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Venezuela operation that saw U.S. forces capture Maduro last week has &#8220;galvanized” the administration’s focus on the western hemisphere. “It has given new impetus for people in government, at the very senior level, to say the President&#8217;s reiterated that the hemisphere is our number one priority. Greenland is very important to him. Let&#8217;s actually go about coming up with a realistic plan for making that happen,” Gray said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as experts parse Trump&#8217;s motivations and examine the feasibility of his territorial ambitions, a murky reality emerges: the economic case is weak, the security rationale is questionable, and the geopolitical costs could be catastrophic.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The shaky economic case</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump officials have repeatedly <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-weighs-special-status-greenland-quest-island-intensifies-2025-05-09/\">pointed</a> to Greenland&#8217;s mineral wealth as justification for U.S. control. The island is estimated to hold 36-42 million metric tons of rare earth oxides—potentially the world&#8217;s second-largest reserve after China. With the global rare earth elements market projected to reach $7.6 billion in 2026, and China controlling 69% of production, securing alternative sources seems like a strategically sound idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Administration officials <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-weighs-special-status-greenland-quest-island-intensifies-2025-05-09/\">told <em>Reuters</em> in May</a> that the U.S. was assisting Greenland diversify its economy to achieve greater economic independence from Denmark. They <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us-weighs-special-status-greenland-quest-island-intensifies-2025-05-09/\">pointed</a> to the Tanbreez Project, which seeks to extract rare earths on the island to be processed in the U.S. as part of this plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Anthony Marchese, chairman of Texas Mineral Resources Corporation who also testified before Congress, gave <em>Fortune</em> a sobering assessment of the mining reality in Greenland: &#8220;If you&#8217;re going to go to Greenland for its minerals, you&#8217;re talking billions upon billions upon billions of dollars and extremely long time before anything ever comes of it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The obstacles are formidable. According to Marchese, the northern part of Greenland is <a href=\"https://discoveryalert.com.au/greenland-mining-frontier-challenges-opportunities-2025/\">only mineable six</a> months out of the year, due to the harsh climate. Mining equipment and fuel, he said, would have to be stored outside in the harsh winter elements for months.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Infrastructure costs compound the challenge. Greenland has virtually no roads connecting its settlements, which are often located on small islands or remote coastal spits of land. It has a limited number of ports. Greenland does not produce enough energy, nor does it have the energy infrastructure to support industrial-scale mining.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254449818.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\"A tower crane on a construction site\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-4392930\" src=\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2254449818.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" original-width=\"5500\" original-height=\"3668\"><figcaption>Despite reported abundances of rare earth minerals, Greenland does not have a developed industrial mining sector. </figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">CARSTEN SNEJBJERG—Bloomberg/Getty Images</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The nation has a population of roughly 56,000 people, most of whom live in southern coastal settlements, including the capital Nuuk. In terms of mining specifically, only one mine in the country is fully operational and the practice itself is widely unpopular among locals and environmental groups. Greenland’s mineral industry generates close to zero revenues. Most operations are still in the exploratory stage. Environmental concerns have made getting mining projects approved in the country especially difficult, Marchese says. And even if a mining operation were to be approved, there is no guarantee it would be lucrative.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going to have hundreds of millions of dollars of drilling to do in order to determine first, is this a deposit that&#8217;s worth mining?&#8221; Marchese says. &#8220;Even if I had all the money in the world, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m just going to go into Greenland next month and start drilling.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More fundamentally, the minerals identified so far are largely uncharacterized. Mineral sampling maps of the island, he says, are almost certainly very lightly sampled, Marchese said. &#8220;Sampling means I go in, I look at a small area, I take a few samples. What it doesn&#8217;t tell you is how large is the deposit? What grade is the deposit?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>His timeline estimate? &#8220;My opinion, 10 to 15 years. No question, given the infrastructure you have to overcome, given the local political situation there.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rebecca Pincus, a senior fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute and Arctic specialist who testified before Congress in March 2025, agrees the economic argument collapses under scrutiny. While she concedes that Greenland has rare earth minerals, the island’s conditions make mining these resources economically irrational. she says. &#8220;That doesn&#8217;t change if Greenland becomes an American territory. There&#8217;s just not a lot of infrastructure there. The climate is really super harsh. Those barriers aren&#8217;t going to magically go away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The hundreds of billions question</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Gray acknowledges the astronomical costs but dismissed them as secondary. His Senate testimony referenced estimates of &#8220;hundreds of billions of dollars&#8221; to acquire and support Greenland—costs stemming from replacing Denmark&#8217;s annual <a href=\"https://www.diis.dk/en/research/why-is-greenland-part-of-the-kingdom-of-denmark-a-short-history\">$600 million subsidy</a> to the nation, massive infrastructure investments, and replicating the safety net Greenlanders currently enjoy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The cost is actually not the most important piece of this,&#8221; Gray insists. &#8220;This is not an economic issue for the United States. This is not a question of dollars and cents. This is not about mineral resources. I see this as a strategic issue, a national security issue with a lot of continuity across centuries.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gray points to U.S. relationships with the Freely Associated States in the Pacific—Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau—as a template. &#8220;We basically provide for their entire defense and we have unlimited access to their land, air and sea. If you look at those relationships, the math has never added up, and those will always be a net deficit from a math perspective for the United States. But they are incalculably valuable from a strategic standpoint.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a significant problem with this comparison, however. According to research by the Danish Institute for International Studies, the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.diis.dk/en/research/why-would-greenlanders-take-a-deal-from-trump-that-gives-them-less-than-they-already\">currently pays</a> the Compact of Free Association (COFA) states approximately $2,025 per capita, while Denmark provides Greenland roughly $12,500 per capita—more than six times as much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gray&#8217;s solution involves creative financing: a minerals and oil trust fund modeled on Alaska&#8217;s Permanent Fund, and distributing universal basic income to every Greenlander. &#8220;I think that&#8217;s a way, an innovative way, that can help take some of the pressure off the U.S. Treasury for funding this whole thing.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this assumes viable mineral extraction—an assumption experts like Marchese consider highly optimistic.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The security rationale under scrutiny</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/07/why-trump-wants-greenland-and-what-makes-it-so-important-for-security.html\">claims</a> &#8220;Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place,&#8221; framing its acquisition as essential to national security. But experts like Pincus dispute this characterization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The idea of the U.S. purchasing or annexing or conquering Greenland is a really maximalist solution to a set of problems that&#8217;s much more modest,&#8221; she told <em>Fortune</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. already operates the Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland, housing critical early warning radar systems for homeland missile defense. &#8220;The U.S. has had this base there since the Cold War, decades and decades. It&#8217;s super important to Homeland Defense,&#8221; Pincus notes. &#8220;The Greenlanders and Danes have made it very clear that they are open to the U.S. making requests for additional presence on Greenland.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2244807080.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\" alt=\"A Danish boat patrols in Greenland\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-4392924\" src=\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/GettyImages-2244807080.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=682\" width=\"1024\" height=\"682\" original-width=\"4000\" original-height=\"2666\"><figcaption>Although Greenland is an autonomous territory, Denmark handles the country&#8217;s defense operations.</figcaption><div class=\"image-credit\">JULIETTE PAVY—Bloomberg/Getty Images</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding Russian threats, Pincus is skeptical: &#8220;I just don&#8217;t see any likelihood of Russia trying to seize Greenland. Why? For what purpose? There&#8217;s been no indication from Russia that they&#8217;re even considering some sort of design on Greenland.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Chinese influence, Pincus acknowledges that the nation has attempted investments in Greenland infrastructure—most notably bidding on airport construction projects. But &#8220;Greenland is not high on China&#8217;s list of priorities,&#8221; she argues. &#8220;Greenlanders are smart and savvy, and they recognize that in the current climate, you can play the U.S. and China off against each other to maximize your benefits.&#8221; When China <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/business/greenlands-courting-of-china-for-airport-projects-worries-denmark-idUSKBN1GY2LJ/\">expressed interest</a> in the airports, &#8220;Copenhagen swooped in and said they would cover it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gray offers a different perspective, warning that an independent Greenland—which has been on a path toward sovereignty for 45 years—would be vulnerable. &#8220;The question is, what&#8217;s greeting them when they become independent? Is it Russia? Is it China? Both of those powers will pounce on Greenland and take advantage of them. They will be absorbed and coerced and lose their sovereignty within hours of becoming an independent country.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>An ego play masquerading as strategy?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Lin Mortensgaard, an international politics of the Arctic specialist at the Danish Institute for International Studies, sees Trump&#8217;s motivations as shifting constantly. &#8220;On Mondays, Trump wants resources. On Tuesdays it&#8217;s for national security, and on Wednesday, it&#8217;s for international security. I think that explicit motivation changes all the time, but I&#8217;m starting to read it more and more as it&#8217;s an ego thing about expanding the American territory,&#8221; she told <em>Fortune</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She points to the administration&#8217;s &#8220;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/what-ceos-need-to-know-about-the-new-donroe-doctrine/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks\">Donroe Doctrine</a>&#8220;—a merger of Trump&#8217;s name with the Monroe Doctrine—as evidence of &#8220;hemisphere thinking&#8221; where &#8220;there&#8217;s a US hemisphere, or sphere of interest. There&#8217;s a Russian sphere of interest, and it&#8217;s a Chinese sphere of interest.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mujtaba Rahman, Managing Director for Europe at Eurasia Group, frames it more starkly: &#8220;The question for the Europeans is: what is it that the Americans want to do that they can&#8217;t already do given the existing governance arrangements that are in place?&#8221; The U.S. already exercises de facto military sovereignty over Greenland through the 1951 Defense Agreement. &#8220;There&#8217;s no Danish opposition to more U.S. bases,” he told <em>Fortune</em>. “That&#8217;s why there is a belief that the goals are different. It&#8217;s real estate, it&#8217;s predatory, it&#8217;s ideology. It&#8217;s about territorial expansion.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The NATO nightmare</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The gravest concern among the majority of experts who spoke with <em>Fortune</em>, however, isn&#8217;t financial—it&#8217;s the potential destruction of NATO. &#8220;This is completely unprecedented, that not only a NATO ally, but the biggest, most powerful state within the NATO alliance threatens another with annexation,&#8221; Mortensgaard says. &#8220;That would really be the end of NATO if there is real fighting between NATO allies.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rahman goes further, arguing that &#8220;Greenland represents a bigger risk to NATO cohesion than Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.&#8221; His logic: &#8220;Russia is an adversary that European countries understand. But if you have the most important country in NATO, the country responsible for European security, now seeking to annex the territory of another NATO member and ally, all of the assumptions that have underpinned the way Europe thinks about the world are completely upended.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Put more simply: &#8220;It involves dealing with America, and America is meant to be a friend, not an enemy,&#8221; he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. allies have already begun voicing concern and even condemnation. Seven major European nations issued a rare joint statement on January 6 <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/greendland-us-denmark-trump-nato-allies-stephen-miller/\">declaring</a> that &#8220;Greenland belongs to its people&#8221; and warning that &#8220;security in the Arctic must be achieved collectively&#8221; while &#8220;upholding the principles of the UN Charter, including sovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of borders.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/denmark-threatens-to-end-postwar-peace-under-nato-if-trump-seizes-greenland/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks\">warned</a> bluntly: &#8220;If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops—that is, including NATO.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What happens next?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Mortensgaard believes actual military action would be symbolically simple but strategically catastrophic. &#8220;In practical terms, it&#8217;s about taking over a few government buildings in Nuuk, which has 20,000 inhabitants, and then hoisting the stars and stripes. So in that sense, it&#8217;s easily done. But the bigger damage of this in NATO terms would be completely unprecedented and actually difficult to compute.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rahman sees a more sophisticated approach emerging: &#8220;A political influence operation that involves political and economic coercion.&#8221; The administration narrative would be &#8220;America is going to liberate you, Greenland, from Denmark,&#8221; targeting &#8220;sympathetic pockets within the population and among the elites that are willing to work with America.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He notes that opposition parties in Greenland are already saying &#8220;we should talk to Trump directly&#8221;—precisely the opening the administration seeks. &#8220;Trump is deeply unpopular in Greenland today. The question is, does he remain unpopular over the medium term if the administration brings to bear economic incentives and attempts to work with local partners to change public opinion over time?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For businesses eyeing Greenland&#8217;s resources, the uncertainty creates what Rahman calls &#8220;a very substantial chilling effect on investment. The Greenland question is now the central question informing the future of the Transatlantic Alliance. As long as that question remains unresolved, I can imagine it would have a chilling effect.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pincus worries the aggressive approach undermines U.S. interests: &#8220;Greenlanders are very proud of their democracy, and they are in pursuit of independence, and the U.S. is acting scary right now. That doesn&#8217;t necessarily help us.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gray remains confident the administration will find a path forward, modeling it on Pacific island relationships that prioritize strategic value over economic return. &#8220;Frankly, the intangible security value to the United States is worth a lot more than any social services calculation,&#8221; he argues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Marchese pointedly asks about the Chinese, who have scoured the globe for rare earth deposits for three decades: &#8220;Why aren&#8217;t they in Greenland? I believe they&#8217;re not stupid people. They&#8217;re all over the world. Why don&#8217;t you see any of that there? I think it&#8217;s just an infrastructure issue. How much money do you want to spend in the billions, and how long is it going to take?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer, experts agree, is measured not in months or single-digit years, but in decades and hundreds of billions of dollars—assuming Greenland&#8217;s people, Denmark, Europe, and the foundations of the Western alliance survive the attempt intact.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/trump-greenland-billions-decades-mineral-experts/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>When Bitcoin first launched in 2009, many investors dismissed the currency as a fringe concept and even as a scam. (Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett&#8217;s former right-hand man at <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/berkshire-hathaway/\" target=\"_blank\">Berkshire Hathaway</a>, memorably called it &#8220;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2022/04/30/bitcoin-stupid-evil-berkshire-hathaway-vice-chair-munger-says-warren-buffett-cryptocurrency/\">stupid and evil</a>.&#8221;) But the asset has skyrocketed in value in recent years and President Donald Trump labeled the currency “digital gold” after <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/03/establishment-of-the-strategic-bitcoin-reserve-and-united-states-digital-asset-stockpile/\">signing an executive order</a> to create a strategic bitcoin reserve last January. Now, reports allege that Venezuela has bought into that “digital gold,” holding a “shadow reserve” nearly double that of the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital publication <a href=\"https://whalehunting.projectbrazen.com/the-60-billion-question-is-venezuela-secretly-a-bitcoin-superpower/\">Project Brazen</a> reported Saturday that Venezuela could hold an estimated $60 billion worth of Bitcoin. Additional intelligence reports allege that ousted Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his associates accrued Bitcoin via three channels: a gold swap overseen by Venezuelan Interior Minister Alex Saab in 2018, oil revenue priced in Bitcoin, and by seizing crypto mining equipment from miners in the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sanctions have walled off the country’s access to financial markets for years, and experts allege that they may have motivated Venezuelan leaders to invest in cryptocurrencies to sidestep the barrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"http://bitcointreasuries.net\">Bitcointreasuries.net</a> puts Venezuela’s holdings at 240 bitcoin, worth nearly $22 million. The website sourced the data from a 2022 <em>Forbes</em> article that cited research from a blockchain analytics firm. The total is a far cry from the estimated U.S. holdings of 328,372, currently worth $30 billion, though the claim positions Venezuela’s holdings at nearly double the U.S. and one of the biggest holders of bitcoin globally.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Some are raising their eyebrows</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The claims of Venezuela’s shadow Bitcoin holdings have predictably garnered skeptics, including digital asset financial services company Ledn Co-founder Mauricio di Bartolomeo, who grew up in Venezuela and whose family has mined crypto there since 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Di Bartolomeo finds no credibility in any of the three alleged sources of bitcoin income: the gold swap, oil exchange or mining equipment seizures. “This to me does not align with anything in the public record,” di Bartolomeo told <em>Fortune.</em> “There’s so much corruption, embezzlement and missing money that I don’t believe that any meaningful amount would have accrued.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He outlined his full argument in a <a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/\">Coindesk</a> op-ed piece titled “<a href=\"https://www.coindesk.com/opinion/2026/01/06/don-t-hold-your-breath-for-venezuela-s-bitcoin\">Don’t hold your breath for Venezuela’s bitcoin</a>.” Though he notes that his family’s crypto mining materials were seized by the government in 2018 and returned five years later in a worn down condition, signaling heavy use of the equipment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Di Bartolomeo says that stablecoins have grown in popularity in Venezuela amid rampant inflation. Many Venezuelans send remittances to their families using stablecoins as the currency has a better exchange rate differential than liquid cash.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The claim’s impact</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It is near impossible to track how much crypto the Venezuelan government holds, given the decentralized and clandestine properties of the asset. However, if true, the claims could potentially reshape global Bitcoin markets. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While most of the U.S. government’s crypto holdings were accrued through law enforcement seizures, the rise of crypto as a state-controlled asset entered the mainstream last year after President Trump signed the executive order to create a national Bitcoin reserve to bolster the U.S’s position in digital assets, at no cost to taxpayers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that the U.S. is in effective control of Venezuela, with ambiguous statements from Trump that the U.S. &#8220;is going to run&#8221; the country, it is unclear what will happen to any Bitcoin reserves that do exist. Real or fake, the claim demonstrates the currency’s growing geopolitical significance and the Trump administration’s willingness to advance its interest in the digital assets industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>[This report has been updated to correct the spelling of Mauricio di Bartolomeo.]</em></p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/corruption-embezzlement-missing-money-venezuela-rumored-60-billion-bitcoin-shadow-reserve/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

But amidst the uncertainty, co-CEO <a href=\"https://fortune.com/article/netflix-warner-bros-merger-ted-sarandos-video-store-job-career-lesson-tony-bennett/\">Ted Sarandos</a> isn’t looking toward traditional management books for leadership advice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, the 61-year-old executive doesn’t like to read business books—at all. He instead often returns to his favorite work of fiction: <em>Typhoon</em>, a 1902 Joseph Conrad novella about a steamship captain and crew navigating a severe storm while at sea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It doesn’t sound like a management story on the surface, but I think it’s the most powerful leadership story I’ve ever read,” Sarandos recently told <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/06/netflix-ceo-this-book-is-the-most-powerful-leadership-story.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><em>CNBC</em></a>. “I read it over and over again because I find &#8230; I get something different in the book every time I read it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Typhoon</em> follows a captain forced to make difficult decisions with limited information as the ship faces extreme conditions. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3537012-typhoon\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Goodreads</a> describes the book as an exploration of leadership, tolerance, and the consequences of making decisions under pressure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Sarandos first read the novella some two decades ago, he admitted he thought the captain was a reckless “hot dog” who was endangering his crew. Over time, his interpretation shifted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Now, what I see is that when you go through life and you go through business, you make a lot of decisions that don’t turn out the way you thought they would,” Sarandos added to <em>CNBC</em>. “The real leadership test is: How do you manage through that?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fortune</em> reached out to Netflix for further comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Even business leaders like Bill Gates and Elon Musk take time to turn off the screen and escape inside a good book</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarandos’s preference for fiction over traditional management books—or <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/americans-reading-less-books-habit-embraced-by-billionaires-ultra-wealthy-bill-gates-oprah-winfrey-gen-z-consequences/\">even reading at all</a>—may surprise some, especially considering reading is on the decline. Less than half of all Americans did not read a single book in 2025, and daily reading for pleasure has plummeted 40% over the past two decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, reading is an activity shared by many of the world’s most influential business leaders. A <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/29/best-habits-for-success-among-billionaires-worlds-wealthiest-families-jpmorgan-report/\">recent JPMorgan survey</a> of more than 100 billionaires found that reading is the most commonly cited habit tied to the success of some of the world’s wealthiest families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> cofounder Bill Gates regularly reads more than 50 books a year. And while many of them end up being works of nonfiction, when he does pick up a work of fiction, he makes sure to “read about interesting characters who help me see the world in a new way.” In a <a href=\"https://www.gatesnotes.com/books/books-home-topic/reader/holiday-books-2025\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">November blog post</a>, Gates recommended <em>Remarkably Bright Creatures</em> by Shelby Van Pelt, a novel about finding meaning in life, especially as you get older.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apple’s CEO Tim Cook has spoken about books that shaped him, citing Phil Knight’s memoir, Malala Yousafzai’s autobiography, and Harper Lee’s <em>To Kill a Mockingbird </em>during a 2023 appearance on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXQYO8poXC8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Dua Lipa’s podcast</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, has also long credited reading with helping him build foundational knowledge. As a child, he said he spent hours immersed in science fiction and encyclopedias. More recently, he encouraged people to read Isaac Asimov’s <em>Foundation</em> series and <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/extended-transcript-spacex-ceo-elon-musk-on-putting-boots-on-the-moon-and-mars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">called</a> <em>The Hitcherhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</em> author Douglas Adams his “favorite philosopher.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’d encourage people to read a lot of books,” Musk <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DxREm3s1scA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said on Lex Fridman’s podcast</a>. “Basically try to ingest as much information as you can and try to develop a good general knowledge.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/netflix-co-ceo-ted-sarandos-reading-habits-fiction-novella-leadership-lessons-like-bill-gates-elon-musk/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

Across the pond in Europe, employees are <a href=\"https://fortune.com/well/2023/04/13/women-workplace-loneliness/\">grappling with</a> the same issue; that’s why one Swedish employer is piloting a paid “friendship hour” to combat isolation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apotek Hjärtat, one of Sweden’s largest pharmaceutical chains, is trialing a “friendcare” program (&#8220;vänvård” in Swedish), where staff are allotted one hour per month, or 15 minutes every week during working hours, to connect with old or new friends.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The year-long scheme was first launched last April, according to <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5ry7749po\">reporting from</a> <em>BBC</em>. Volunteers could register for the initiative if they were lonely, or simply wanted to get closer to people struggling with isolation—just 11 out of 4,000 employees opted in&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The business has not only set aside work hours to test the initiative, it’s also been footing the bill for connection.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All participants are paid 1,000 kronor (around $100) to cover activities with their companions. But the “friendship hour” doesn’t have to be spent dining out for lunch, or biking around town; staffers can use the time for the simplest relationship pastimes, such as chatting on the phone or catching up over text.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Improving workers’ wellbeing is actually a benefit for the company</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Monica Magnusson, the CEO of Apotek Hjärtat, told <em>BBC </em>the “friendship hour” scheme came about out of genuine curiosity: the company wanted to see if this allotted employee time would improve staff wellbeing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We try and see what the effects are from having the opportunity to spend a bit of time every week on safeguarding your relationships,” Magnusson <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g5ry7749po\">told the</a> <em>BBC.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The program is likened to Sweden’s broader “friskvård” benefit: an annual tax-exempt<em> </em>stipend covering employee wellness activities, such as fitness classes and massages. Magnusson said the “friendship hour” is “a reflection on that, but targeting loneliness and relationships instead.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But even Apotek Hjärtat employees not participating in the pilot can still benefit emotionally from another initiative; the business provides online training for all its staffers on how to recognize and handle loneliness.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fortune </em>reached out to Apotek Hjärtat for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The $154 billion employee loneliness problem</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Loneliness has swept through offices across the U.S.; around 79% of white-collar employees have felt lonely as a result of their role within the past month, according to a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/07/25/loneliness-epidemic-us-workers-job-isolation/\">2024 study</a> from BSG in partnership with TheLi.st and Berlin Cameron. The issue not only leads to higher turnover, weakened company culture, and sluggish employee morale—it’s also costing businesses billions of dollars every year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s estimated that loneliness among U.S. staffers results in a $154 billion loss annually, or about $4,200 in lost workdays per staffer each year, according to a <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/358749558_Loneliness_influences_avoidable_absenteeism_and_turnover_intention_reported_by_adult_workers_in_the_United_States/link/62cc79a800d0b4511049d9b3/download?_tp=eyJjb250ZXh0Ijp7ImZpcnN0UGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIiwicGFnZSI6InB1YmxpY2F0aW9uIn19\">2022 study</a> from Project Connect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there’s hope that these employer-led initiatives could help turn the tide on loneliness—and there’s a business imperative to do so. Employees are 3.5 times more likely to reach their full potential when they feel connected, according to a <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2019/02/the-surprising-power-of-simply-asking-coworkers-how-theyre-doing\">2019 study</a> from the Harvard Business Review. When staffers are connected, they also perform better on the job: around eight in 10 workers believe a sense of community would help them be better at work, according to a 2025 <a href=\"https://www.randstad.com/workmonitor/\">Randstad report</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If employers choose to turn a blind eye to their isolated staffers, it could hurt them in the long run. About 55% of professionals would consider quitting if they didn’t feel a sense of belonging on the job, a massive increase from 37% who said the same in 2024, according to the <a href=\"https://www.randstad.com/workmonitor/\">Randstad report</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\"/>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Are you a CEO intentionally combating post-pandemic workplace loneliness? </em>Fortune<em> wants to hear from you!

The magnets that CFS manufactures are theoretically strong enough to lift an aircraft carrier out of the water, Mumgaard said. SPARC will nearly be completed by the end of 2026 and will produce its first plasma energy in 2027.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The main argument against fusion is making it work, and that’s why we’re building SPARC and showing that it can work,” Mumgaard told <em>Fortune </em>in an interview prior to the keynote. “That will be a big moment for fusion overall, not just for us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If SPARC succeeds, CFS’ first commercial fusion plant, ARC, is slated to be built and to come online in the early 2030s just outside of Richmond, Virginia. If all goes as planned, the 400-megawatt plant would become the world’s first fusion plant providing steady power to the grid—enough to power about 300,000 homes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas traditional nuclear fission energy creates power by splitting atoms, fusion uses heat to create energy by melding them together. In the simplest form, it fuses hydrogen found in water into an extremely hot, electrically charged state known as plasma to create helium—the same process that powers the sun. When executed properly, the process triggers endless reactions to make energy for electricity. But stars rely on overwhelming gravitational pressure to force their fusion. Here on Earth, creating and containing the pressure needed to force the reaction in a consistent, controlled way remains an engineering challenge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CFS is now working with Nvidia Omniverse AI tech and Siemens industrial software to create a digital twin of the SPARC project to experiment, process data, and answer questions without having to open up the physical machinery. CFS also works with Google <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/deepmind/\" target=\"_blank\">DeepMind</a> AI systems. CFS likens DeepMind to a co-pilot and the Nvidia digital twin to the virtual airplane.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The way to think about it is that the physical world and the digital world are increasingly merging, and we&#8217;re increasingly able to get the best out of both sides,” Mumgaard said, arguing that he’s optimistic the digital twin tech will accelerate the development of ARC.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251229-CFS-SPARC-Facility-TF1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" alt=\" The TF1 magnet, a key component of the SPARC fusion demonstration machine, was recently installed in Tokamak Hall at Commonwealth Fusion Systems in Devens, Mass.\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-4392389\" src=\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/20251229-CFS-SPARC-Facility-TF1.jpg?w=1024&#038;h=683\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" original-width=\"9504\" original-height=\"6336\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trumped up competition</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There is of course competition, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-nuclear-fusion-tae-technologies-michl-binderbauer/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/18/trump-media-nuclear-fusion-tae-technologies-michl-binderbauer/\">including even from the</a> Trump family.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December, the Trump Media &amp; Technology Group and fusion developer TAE Technologies announced an unexpected $6 billion merger to become the first fusion player to go public—soon owned in part by the Trump family—on a belief that an influx of capital will speed up the launch of fusion power on the grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal is for a so-called merger of equals with Trump Media, which will become a Truth Social media, cryptocurrency, and fusion power conglomerate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Having a public fusion company was something I think the industry always expected to happen. I don&#8217;t think anyone had it on their bingo card for it to happen quite this way. But it&#8217;s good to have one, and I wish them success,” Mumgaard told <em>Fortune</em>. “With the Trump connection, fusion has been bipartisan, and we&#8217;d like to make sure it stays bipartisan.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CFS also is racing against others competitors such as Helion—backed by OpenAI’s Sam Altman and SoftBank—which aims to build a fusion plant east of Seattle to power <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> data centers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>CFS is the leader in the most common form of fusion tech—the oddly named “tokamak.” The tokamak—shortened from toroidal chamber magnetic—relies on its powerful magnets. The design essentially involves a massive, doughnut-shaped machine that traps the plasma in a high-temperature, superconducting magnetic field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The running joke is that fusion power is mythical and it’s always 30 years away. Not so any longer, Mumgaard said, even if it will still take a couple of decades before fusion is a key player in the global power grid.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Parts are arriving and it&#8217;s being assembled,” Mumgaard said of SPARC. “It’s a complicated <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/lego/\" target=\"_blank\">Lego</a> set, but we have a good set of instructions and a good set of people that will put it together.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/fusion-power-commonwealth-sparc-nuclear-fusion-pilot-ai-siemens-nvidia/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 hit a new record high yesterday, up 0.62% at 6,944.82. Futures are marginally down this morning, as might be expected from traders who want to sell up and lock in some of those gains. The STOXX Europe 600 also hit a new high yesterday and was flat in early trading this morning.<br><br>Much of the bullishness is coming as analysts realize that the massive amounts of capital expenditure (capex) on building out AI data centers isn&#8217;t likely to stop anytime soon.<br><br>The result of all that new spending will be that “we expect another year of solid gains for U.S. equities in 2026. We forecast an S&amp;P 500 total return of 12% to a year-end level of 7,600,” Goldman Sachs analyst Ben Snider and his colleagues told clients in a note sent this morning.<br><br>However, the wrinkle for 2026 will be that AI capex growth will start to slow down, he said. In turn, the amount of profit needed to justify all that capex won’t show up, Snider <em>et al</em> argue, and that will cause traders to pick and choose winners and losers among the big tech firms of the S&amp;P 500.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The 10 largest stocks in the S&amp;P 500 account for 41% of market cap and drove 53% of the S&amp;P 500 2025 return. We expect AI spending will exceed consensus estimates this year but begin to decelerate in growth terms while corporate adoption increases, causing rotations among the largest U.S. tech stocks that create two-way risk for the aggregate index,” he told clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Capex spending by the big “hyperscalers” (<a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/facebook/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a>, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/\" target=\"_blank\">Alphabet</a>, etc.) was roughly $400 billion in 2025, up 70% annually, Goldman calculates. The big tech companies have also started to fund much of that growth with debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As spending and debt grow, so do the necessary eventual profits to justify ongoing investments,” Snider says.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So far, tech companies have been happy to spend that money because the profits they generated were two or three times as much as they invested, Goldman estimates. The problem is that that might be unsustainable, Snider says. “Given consensus estimates for an annual average of $500 billion in capex from 2025-2027, maintaining the returns on capital to which their investors have become accustomed would require these companies to realize an annual profit run-rate of over $1 trillion, more than double the 2026 consensus estimate of $450 billion in income,” he wrote.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While some of these companies will successfully generate the profits they need, others won’t, he says. “The magnitudes of current spending and market caps alongside increasing competition within the group suggest a diminishing probability that all of today’s market leaders generate enough long-term profits to sufficiently reward today’s investors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Analysts at <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/vanguard/\" target=\"_blank\">Vanguard</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/piper-sandler/\" target=\"_blank\">Piper Sandler</a> are also focused on the AI-capex-profit story.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Piper chief global economist Nancy R. Lazar and her colleagues anticipate that tech companies have not yet reached the ceiling of their capex budgets, especially as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBA) grants new tax breaks on companies’ capital spending. “Tech capex has been a huge story for a while now, but against history, it’s still not ‘too high’ vs. GDP. And there’s plenty of upside ahead, given OBBA’s full capex expensing, Fed easing, and banks easing lending standards,” they told clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vanguard’s Qian Wang, global head of capital market research, also warned that if profits don’t follow capex then investors should expect a downturn. “We are bullish on AI’s potential to transform the economy. But transformative technology needs profitable business models to win. And, in the financial markets, returns hinge on expectations. Tech companies’ earnings have been strong so far, but their valuations may have gotten ahead of themselves. When expectations get too far out of whack, it is not surprising to see markets pull back,” she said in an email sent to <em>Fortune</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 futures</strong> were up flat this morning.

The United States doesn&#8217;t have troops on the ground, isn&#8217;t deploying any major resources, and has reportedly already secured a $2 billion oil deal. <br><br>As such, markets have been fairly indifferent to the action, despite it raising geopolitical tensions. Their reasoning is likely to be that an apparent win for the world&#8217;s largest economy is good news for everyone—particularly if it comes without too much conflict and cost. <br><br>On the latter point, a snag has emerged: President Trump has now suggested the U.S. <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/02/government-shutdown-january-deadline-federal-funding-agreement/\">may end up reimbursing</a> the &#8220;tremendous amount of money&#8221; needed to be spent by oil companies to rebuild Venezuela&#8217;s infrastructure. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The reasoning behind the U.S.&#8217;s interest in accessing Venezuela&#8217;s oil industry is clear: According to self-reported figures, the nation claims to have the largest oil reserves in the world, estimated at around 300 billion barrels. These haven&#8217;t been audited, and as Apollo&#8217;s Torsten Sløk wrote in a note to clients: &#8220;Venezuela’s self-reported crude oil reserves tripled from around 100 billion barrels in the early 2000s to 300 billion barrels in the late 2000s due to the reclassification of Orinoco Belt heavy oil as &#8216;proved.'&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Much of the oil is extra-heavy, which has low recovery and a high cost to produce. There was no large new discovery or production increase to justify a tripling of reserves through exploration alone.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, the opportunity for America to diversify its oil supplies, and potentially direct stock away from its economic rival China, may still be too good to pass up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Previously, President Trump had claimed America&#8217;s major oil companies would be the ones putting their hands in their pockets to build the infrastructure needed to access this proverbial gold mine. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But speaking to <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/business/energy/trump-venezuela-oil-companies-reimburse-rcna252434\">NBC News</a> earlier this week, he said that while the Venezuelan oil industry could be expanded and running within the next 18 months,&nbsp;&#8220;it’ll be a lot of money.&#8221; He added: &#8220;A tremendous amount of money will have to be spent, and the oil companies will spend it, and then they’ll get reimbursed by us or through revenue.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president declined to speculate how much oil companies would spend (and how much the U.S. government may be on the hook for as a result), simply saying it will be a &#8220;substantial&#8221; amount of money &#8220;but they’ll do very well.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Counting the cost</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the suggestion that the U.S. government may end up footing the bill for rebuilding Venezuela&#8217;s oil infrastructure, analysts were of the opinion that the action would do little to move the economic needle. As Michael Pearce, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote in a note to clients Monday: &#8220;The U.S. attack on Venezuela over the weekend dramatically increases uncertainty about the future of its political regime, but the impacts for global oil prices and geopolitical tensions appear limited. Therefore, we won&#8217;t change our baseline forecast for the U.S. economy.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He highlighted that trade and financial linkages between the nations are far smaller today than previously, after decades of sanctions and political pressure. American exports to Venezuela were just $3.6 billion over the past 12 months, less than 0.2% of total exports, while imports are similarly small and banking-sector exposure is low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But other economists are already nervously eyeing the longer term, questioning whether tensions will escalate and the U.S. will be forced to employ a heavier (and more expensive) hand which has ramifications for America&#8217;s sizeable budget deficit. The likes of Paul Donovan at UBS said earlier this week this would be a key concern for investors. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Desmond Lachman, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said the same thing: “My problem is that the budget deficit is so bad to begin with, and Venezuela is certainly not going to improve it. If anything, Venezuela makes it worse, so I think we’ve really got a big budget problem.” </p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/trump-venezuela-plan-expensive-oil-infrastructure/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

The U.S. State Department posted, “This is our hemisphere.” And Trump aide Stephen Miller said the U.S. could next seize Greenland, arguing we live in a “real world” governed by strength, force, and power. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s what leaders need to know about the “Trump Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine—which Trump renamed the &#8220;Donroe&#8221; doctrine—to dominate the Western Hemisphere and exert influence over its<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/03/trump-venezuelan-regime-change-nicolas-maduro-oil-us-energy-companies-investment/\"> oil, gas, and critical minerals</a> for national security purposes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Welcome to the age of ‘petro diplomacy’</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuela was clearly a warning shot to the hemisphere and the world, says Dan Pickering, founder of the Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm. Why now? The U.S. leads the world in oil and natural gas production, but its industries are maturing, meanwhile the U.S. needs help with critical minerals supply chains dominated by China. “Anything to keep more production close and friendly, I think we want to do,” Pickering told <em>Fortune</em>. That said, “Any next military step [beyond Venezuela] seems a lot harder to justify.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Some fear Trump’s gambit could embolden our enemies</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These are neocon fantasies. People don’t like their governments, but they really don’t like the U.S. coming in and dictating to them,” observes David Goldwyn, Atlantic Council fellow and State Department special envoy for international energy in the Obama administration. Military action against Venezuela doesn’t deter China and Russia, it emboldens and incentivizes them to act against Taiwan and Ukraine, respectively, he said. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It will be years before U.S. companies see a profit in Venezuela</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Venezuela is home to the world’s largest oil reserves, its dilapidated industry produces less than 1% of the world’s oil. Trump can say the U.S. oil companies are going back into Venezuela, but doing so is risky and requires tens of billions of dollars of expenses over several years before it could become profitable.<em>—Jordan Blum</em><br><br><em>Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at <a href=\"mailto:diane.brady@fortune.com\">diane.brady@fortune.com</a></em></p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/what-ceos-need-to-know-about-the-new-donroe-doctrine/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>It’s no secret that getting a new job is hard, with candidates constantly complaining about the endless hoops that recruiters are making them jump through to prove they’re the perfect match, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/europe/2024/04/30/john-lewis-retail-giant-giving-candidates-questions-before-job-interview-nerves-impact-performance/\">from endless rounds of interviews</a> to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/04/29/gen-z-job-seeker-refused-90-minute-task-recruiter-slammed/\">90-minute tests</a> and presentations. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But for young people in particular, the challenge is even steeper. About a fifth of Gen Zers worldwide are classified as “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/article/gen-z-are-increasingly-becoming-neets/\">NEETs</a>” and are currently locked out of the job market. Last year in the U.K. alone, more than 1.2 million applications were <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/28/gen-z-job-crisis-real-1-2-million-graduates-17000-jobs-uk-ai-labor-market-colleges/\">submitted</a> for fewer than 17,000 graduate roles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Goldman <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/10/14/goldman-economists-gen-z-hiring-nightmare-low-fire-hire-jobless-growth-normal/\">economists</a> have admitted Gen Z’s hiring nightmare is real—and it isn’t <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/21/goodwill-ceo-preparing-for-influx-of-jobless-gen-z-ai-automation-kill-entry-level-jobs-youth-unemployment-crisis/\">going away</a> anytime soon.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As millions of Gen Zers face unemployment and entry-level office roles becoming scarcer, hiring managers are being forced to get creative to find the very best candidates. So <em>Fortune</em> has rounded up the curveball make-or-break interview questions now shaping hiring decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do you think we are in an AI bubble?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think we’re in an AI bubble? Even the experts who’ve predicted past crashes can’t seem to agree. But if you’re looking for a job right now, your opinion on all this could decide whether you get the job. Dave McCann, IBM’s managing partner for EMEA, says he now <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/01/ibm-exec-asks-job-candidates-whether-they-think-we-are-in-an-ai-bubble-as-a-make-or-break-interview-test/\">throws the curveball question</a> in interviews as a make-or-break test.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s no right or wrong answer, but actually knowing where you stand could give you an edge and pique the exec’s interest. McCann doesn’t care which side you pick—he cares whether you’ve thought it through.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you design a car for a deaf person?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/lyft/\" target=\"_blank\">Lyft</a> CEO David Risher likes to ask candidates: “Design a car for a deaf person.” The curveball question may sound unusual, but for Risher, it’s a quick way to “suss out” whether a candidate can put themselves in the shoes of a customer—and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/29/lyft-ceo-david-risher-unusual-job-interview-question-suss-out-candidates-inspired-from-amazon-founder-jeff-bezos/\">he got the idea</a> from his time working with Jeff Bezos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I want to see the candidate close their eyes and ears and imagine what that feels like, then be able to describe the experience to me in detail, including what someone in that position might need,” Risher said. “That’s how I know I’ve got someone who can build great customer-obsessed experiences.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Do you have any questions for me?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The question that turns its head on the interviewee and enables them to put the hiring manager in the hot seat isn’t an unusual one. But for Twilio’s CEO Khozema Shipchandler, it’s what comes next that matters most.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If your answer is a blank stare or “Nope, I’m fine,” consider yourself on thin ice.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The number one red flag for me is when someone doesn’t ask questions towards the end of an interview,” Shipchandler exclusively <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/10/16-billion-twilio-ceo-job-interviews-mistake-listening-for-one-word-not-hired-if-you-say-it-too-much/\">told <em>Fortune</em></a>. “That’s a pretty significant mark against them being curious about what they’re interviewing, the company, the way we might work together, chemistry, culture, all of those things.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Denny’s CEO Kelli Valade echoed that it doesn’t really matter what you ask employers at the end of the interview—the fact that you do ask something shows you did your homework, are seriously interested and is a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/07/27/dennys-corporation-ceo-kelli-valade-hiring-interview-question-worker-improvement/\">big green flag.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Can you start right away?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Picture this: You’ve spent hours applying for the dream job and sitting through multiple interviews. Finally, you think you’ve won over the hiring manager when they ask, “when can you start?”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You’d be forgiven for thinking the right answer, is “straight away.” After all, you want to seem eager. But Gary Shapiro, the chief executive of U.S. trade association Consumer Technology Association, revealed that he<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/11/01/ceo-rejects-job-candidates-who-start-right-away/\"> turns candidates down</a> who say they’re available within two weeks. “They don’t get the job, because they’ll treat us the way they treat that former employer.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Other things to look out for: Coffee cup tests, pricey menu items and wait staff</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s not just what you say in the interview that could cost you the job. Hiring managers are also watching what you do—as early as when you walk through the revolving doors and great reception. They’re looking at how you treat staff before and after your interview, as well as, what you do with the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/04/06/job-interview-coffee-cup-test-recruiters-hiring-green-flag-red-flags/\">coffee (or tea) cup </a>you were drinking from. Hint: offering to clean it up will go down will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other hiring managers take their prospective new hires out for a lunch interview and watch for whether they season their food before taking a bite. Why? Because putting salt (or anything) on your food before tasting it is the equivalent of judging a book by its cover and apparently, highlights a lack of patience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s not all. They’re also testing you for how quickly you order, whether you wait for others to sit before sitting down to eat, the price of the items you order, and how you treat wait staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One consultant even <a href=\"https://x.com/patricklencioni/status/1236016388491431936\">revealed on X</a> that he knows a CEO who goes as far as taking candidates for breakfast and secretly asking the servers to mess up their order “to see how they’d react.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/gen-z-hiring-interview-questions-from-ceos/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/sap-ceo-christian-klein-2026-prediction-nobody-knows-whats-next/",
      "content": "\n<p>Every December, business leaders engage in a familiar ritual: offering predictions for the year ahead. I’ve participated in the ritual myself. But after a year defined by AI volatility, climate shocks, supply chain disruptions, and regulatory curveballs, one thing feels clearer than any forecast: Nobody knows what’s next.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, leaders could predict the future based on the past. Planning cycles were stable. Forecasts aged slower. The pace of change allowed companies to map multi-year strategies. That world is gone. Today’s volatility reflects a structural shift in how business operates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn’t mean leaders should stop planning. It means we need a different kind of plan, built for a world where nothing is certain and adaptability is the real competitive advantage.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The Problem with </strong>&#8216;<strong>Certaint</strong>y&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Six years ago, at the start of the pandemic, the world underwent change on an almost unprecedented scale. Many assumptions that had held true for years were shattered: business models shifted overnight; strategy road maps were suddenly irrelevant; and the future we had been preparing for was already outdated. As long-range predictions failed, organizations focused instead on being able to adjust quickly to evolving conditions .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the years since, this lesson has only been further underscored by Black Swan events and significant technological advancements. AI is redefining the way we live, study, and work, but we’re racing to fully understand the implications of this change. Quantum computing, once considered distant, is entering near-term planning. Innovation is moving faster than the forecasts meant to describe it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real danger is the false sense of confidence forecasts can create. When we assume we know what’s coming, we anchor our strategies to timelines and expectations that may evaporate when reality shifts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier in my career, I fell into this trap myself. I sometimes waited for perfect clarity before making decisions. Today, I’d rather make the call than stay frozen in place. When I look back, the only choices I regret are the ones I waited too long to make – or didn’t make at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders work without the luxury of certainty, and progress depends on getting comfortable with that reality.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leading Through Contradiction</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>If long-term forecasts can no longer be the compass by which we navigate our businesses, what replaces it? Every leader I speak with is wrestling with scenarios that seem almost impossible to solve, yet success now depends on exactly that: We’re expected to move fast while acting responsibly, introduce automation while keeping people engaged, and pursue bold innovation while shaping the guardrails that keep it trustworthy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders must hold these competing demands simultaneously. That’s our job. These tensions are the norm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A moment in SAP’s own transformation crystallized this reality for me. Early in my tenure as CEO, we announced a major shift from our on-premise business to focus fully on the cloud. It was without doubt the right step for SAP’s long-term future. But I knew it would trigger turbulence in the short term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When the announcement hit, our stock dropped sharply. The initial negative reaction wasn’t exactly a complete surprise, but that didn’t make it any easier. Our North Star in those early days was the unshakable conviction that it was the right thing to do, and it was my job as the leader of <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/sap/\" target=\"_blank\">SAP</a> to explain the direction, steady the organization, and maintain the momentum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is as much about cultural transformation as it is about technical change. Uncertainty among employees about the transformation can easily and quickly erode morale. That’s why constant communication is so important – always making sure the teams understood not just&nbsp;<em>what</em>&nbsp;we were doing, but&nbsp;<em>why</em>. In times of change, you simply cannot over-communicate.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>The New Leadership Mindset for 2026</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, the experience of SAP’s transformation has reaffirmed for me that leadership is about advancing through volatility – not waiting for conditions to stabilize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, rather than offer predictions this year, I’m offering a shift in perspective that I hope more leaders embrace: stop chasing certainty. Stop waiting for perfect information. Stop anchoring decisions to forecasts that will never be stable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A stronger approach is rooted in readiness. Designing systems that flex when assumptions fail. Implementing technology that adapts to realities we can’t yet see. Empowering teams to be able to respond no matter what the future may hold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The companies that succeed in 2026 won’t be the ones that guess best. They’ll be the ones that strengthened their capacity to adapt and prepared their people and systems for a future that rarely behaves as expected.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great leadership isn’t about knowing more. It’s about preparing better. And the most honest prediction we can make is that uncertainty is here to stay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>The opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of </em>Fortune<em>.</em></p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/sap-ceo-christian-klein-2026-prediction-nobody-knows-whats-next/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "title": "Business leaders are growing more optimistic, JPMorgan survey finds",
      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/business-leaders-are-growing-more-optimistic/",
      "content": "\n<p>At the start of 2026, there are some positive signs about how people are viewing the economy. That’s according to a new JPMorgan survey, which finds that 39% of business leaders have an optimistic view of the economy. That number is up from 32% during a midyear survey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The data was gathered by interviewing more than 1,400 leaders of midsize businesses across industries. JPMorgan has conducted this survey for the past 15 years. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Middle market business leaders are beginning 2026 with a renewed sense of optimism after navigating a year of heightened uncertainty,” said Melissa Smith, co-head of commercial banking at JPMorgan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey follows an up and down year for the U.S. economy. President Donald Trump’s tariff threats in April led to a steep drop in the stock market, but the market subsequently bounced back to end 2025 at record highs. The economic picture got a bit rosier in December, when the Federal Reserve cut rates for a third time in the calendar year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news is not all good, however, as many view the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/07/what-is-the-k-shaped-economy-wealth-inequality-explainer/\">economy as K-shaped</a>, meaning that the wealthy get wealthier, while the rest of Americans battle high living costs and growing unemployment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite 2025’s volatility, business leaders were particularly bullish on how their own companies would fare in 2026. 71% of them had an optimistic outlook for their own company’s performance this coming year, and 64% expect higher profits during that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To bring in more money, those surveyed said they would invest in innovation. 58% of business leaders said they would introduce new products and services, which is up from 53% last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This comes as concerns grew among the public in 2025 about a possible <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/09/28/ai-dot-com-bubble-parallels-history-explained-companies-revenue-infrastructure/\">AI bubble</a> that, like the dot-com crash in early 2000, could trigger an economic downturn, or even recession. There is also the worry that <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/17/ai-layoff-wave-just-beginning-by-design-jobless-growth/\">AI will take people’s jobs</a>, if it hasn’t already. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of those surveyed by JPMorgan, however, did not share such fears. In fact, 51% of business leaders interviewed said they do not expect a recession, while only 26% expect a recession or believe the U.S. is already in one. The business leaders also said that they do not think that AI will affect their workforce, as 60% of those surveyed said that AI would neither increase nor decrease headcount.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These leaders at midsize companies seem confident despite an uncertain environment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Business leaders have had to navigate a rapidly changing and increasingly complex landscape over the past 12 months, but they have shown their resilience and are putting plans back in motion,” Smith added.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/business-leaders-are-growing-more-optimistic/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Shares in fast food chain Jollibee surged by over 14% on Tuesday, its largest jump since 2008, after it announced that it would split its domestic and overseas businesses. The company also hopes to list its international arm in the U.S. by late 2027. Jollibee shares, which trade in the Philippines, rose by an additional 7.6% on Wednesday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement filed to the Philippine Stock Exchange, Jollibee said the splitting of its two business arms will sharpen the strategic focus of each, allowing investors to differentiate between its “stable, cash-generative Philippine business” and its “higher-growth but more volatile international operations”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jollibee dominates the Filipino fast food market. In addition to its flagship fried chicken Jollibee, it also operates other brands like barbecue chain Mang Inasal and Chinese chain Chowking, as well as the local franchise for foreign brands like Burger King.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet the Filipino food chain is now setting its sights on becoming a global powerhouse, competing with the likes of McDonald’s and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/yum-brands/\" target=\"_blank\">Yum Brands</a>. Jollibee opened its first international store in Singapore in 1985, and its first U.S. store in 1998 in Daly City, California, where there was a large Filipino-American population. It has since expanded to 81 stores across fifteen states, including Texas, Florida, Nevada, New York and Washington, adding to a global footprint across Asia, North America, the Middle East, and Oceania.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the early 2000s, the Jollibee group has also acquired foreign brands, like Smashburger, Tim Ho Wan and Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, just over 75% of the company’s operating income is earned in the Filipino market, according to the company’s latest quarterly earnings report. Some global businesses, like Jollibee’s coffee and tea chains, as well as burger outlet Smashburger, have struggled with intense competition and low profitability.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Global expansion</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Jollibee was founded in 1975 by Filipino businessman Tony Tan Caktiong, in Cubao, Quezon City. Though it first opened as an ice cream parlor, the restaurant quickly added hot meals like burgers and pasta to meet customer appetites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2024, Jollibee CEO Ernesto Tanmantiong told <em>Fortune</em> his goal was for the firm to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/asia/2024/06/17/jollibee-southeast-asia-500-jfc-ernesto-tanmantiong-acquisitions-global-brands/\">become one of the world’s top five restaurant companies by market cap</a>. “We said we had to be the No. 1 Asian food company in Asia. And then when we were again about to achieve that, we set our vision to the world arena.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As of September, the conglomerate owns 10,304 stores—more than half of which operate in locations outside the Philippines. The portion of its revenue generated abroad has also been increasing steadily, from 21% in 2017 to 43% in 2025.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With $4.71 billion in annual revenue, Jollibee is currently No. 79 on the 2025 Fortune Southeast Asia 500, a jump of 7 spots from the year before. It’s the ninth-highest-ranked Filipino company on the list.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/jollibee-shares-surge-us-ipo-spinoff/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Last year was a roller coaster ride, but a market rebound has pushed mega banks’ stock growth nearly 30% and record compensation and bonuses are likely to follow.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leading the charge is <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/jpmorgan-chase/\" target=\"_blank\">JPMorgan Chase</a> CEO and chairman Jamie Dimon, one of the last sitting Wall Street leaders to have navigated the 2008 financial crisis, the subsequent passage of the Dodd-Frank reform act, and now the AI boom. Dimon has spent the past 20 years atop JPMorgan and is know for rarely cashing in his stock. With that bent, he amassed an ownership stake in JPMorgan of nearly <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/proxy-statement2024.pdf\">8.5 million shares</a>, and only began shaving off his holdings in a small handful of <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2024/02/23/jamie-dimon-and-his-inner-circle-at-jpmorgan-offloaded-nearly-170-million-in-stock-as-the-banks-share-price-hit-a-new-high/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks\">pre-planned sales</a> in 2024, beginning with a sale valued at $150 million.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dimon started off 2025 with about <a href=\"https://www.secform4.com/filings/19617/0001225208-25-001073.htm\">7.3 million shares</a>. With a <a href=\"https://www.jpmorganchase.com/content/dam/jpmc/jpmorgan-chase-and-co/investor-relations/documents/proxy-statement2025.pdf\">per-share price</a> of $239.71, his stake was valued at roughly $1.8 billion. The stock price soared to $322.22 at the end of 2025, pushing the stock value of his stake up to about $2.4 billion, which meant Dimon saw about $605.6 million in appreciation plus another $40 million in dividends. This year, he’ll see a <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000001961721000371/jpm-20210720.htm\">1.5 million stock appreciation right </a>grant vest due to a special one-time award the board gave him in 2021. All told, through stock value gains, dividends, and compensation, Dimon will see about $770 million for his work in 2025, according to reporting by the <em>New York Times</em> that was verified for <em>Fortune</em> by independent compensation firm <a href=\"https://farient.com/2025/12/18/global-ceo-pay-u-s-leads-tech-titans-surge-performance-equity-prevails/\">Farient Advisors</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Jamie Dimon has been rewarded for his loyalty, tenure, and performance over the course of these years,” said Eric Hoffmann, vice president and chief data officer at Farient. Hoffmann noted Dimon has accumulated a lot of equity through his compensation plan, personal purchases, and via the 2021 special award designed to retain him while the board worked through succession planning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The stock’s appreciated by more than a third, and he’s a beneficiary of that like all the shareholders of JPMorgan are,” said Hoffmann.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dimon’s “compensation actually paid,&#8221; a regulator-required figure determined by a Securities and Exchange Commission <a href=\"https://www.sec.gov/files/rules/final/2022/34-95607.pdf\">rule</a>, was calculated at roughly $227 million in 2024; $105 million in 2023; and $38 million in 2022, in comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In contrast, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> founder Jeff Bezos has been on a bit of a <a href=\"https://www.secform4.com/filings/1018724/0001018724-25-000080.htm\">selling</a> <a href=\"https://www.secform4.com/filings/1018724/0001018724-25-000078.htm\">spree</a>. During 2025, Bezos sold 25 million shares of Amazon for a total of roughly $5.65 billion, according to his <a href=\"https://www.secform4.com/filings/1018724/0001018724-25-000082.htm\">disclosures</a>. Like most executive insiders, Bezos sold his shares using pre-arranged sales known as a 10b5-1 trading plan. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Securities Industry Profits on Pace for Record</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>JPMorgan’s C-suite isn’t the only place seeing gains.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Securities industry profits are expected to top $60 billion for 2025, according to previous <a href=\"https://www.osc.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/10/dinapoli-wall-street-profits-surge-again-giving-new-york-fiscal-boost\">estimates</a> from the New York State Comptroller. In comparison, profits for the prior year totaled $49.9 billion, the fourth-highest on record. (The state analyzes securities industry profits and bonuses for city and state tax collection purposes.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Financial services compensation consultancy Johnson Associates called 2025 a surprisingly positive year for financial firms, despite early concerns about tariffs and geopolitical instability that could have hit compensation. Johnson Assocites&#8217; November 2025 report, “Unexpected 2025 Rebound in a Changing Industry,” found that compensation across financial sectors exceeded expectations, with increases from 5% to 25%, depending on role and business segment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Founder Alan Johnson told <em>Fortune</em> that 2025 was a year when traditional banks came “roaring back, absolutely” despite the early warning signs and uncertainties. As Johnson tells it, 2024 didn’t quite end up as strong as it could have been and people were hopeful about 2025. Cut to tariffs, which turned out not as bad as predicted while many were walked back, and the second half of the year saw more M&amp;A, trading activity, and new highs in the stock market.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The second half of the year was a sprint to the finish line, and the first few days of this year continue to look really good,” said Johnson.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there are looming challenges ahead, he warned. Headcount in financial services has increased 77% since the financial crisis, and it could decline by 10% to 20% during the next three to five years as AI transforms business operations. Johnson said most CEOs don’t like to talk about it directly, but there will be fewer jobs. His clients are already reducing their recruitment efforts to bring on fewer entry-level hires. How it will reshape traditional career trajectories is yet to be determined, he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“These firms have had a hierarchy that goes back decades that’s pretty well established and understood and this turns it on its head,” said Johnson. “If you hire fewer people at the bottom, how do you then develop people for the middle or the top? There won’t be as many candidates and they won’t have had the same career experience.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don’t think anyone has figured that out.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/07/jamie-dimon-pay-770-million-jpmorgan-ceo-bonus/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Recruiting teams are, in many ways, ground zero for AI disruption. A plethora of tasks historically performed by recruiters can now be performed by AI technology. But…with a world of possibilities at one’s fingertips, it can be difficult to know where to begin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real estate tech giant <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/zillow-group/\" target=\"_blank\">Zillow</a> has launched several AI tools for recruitment since it began experimenting in late 2023. HR Brew recently sat down with Roz Harris, Zillow’s VP of talent acquisition, engagement, and belonging, to discuss how her recruitment team has identified and adopted AI solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Where to begin?</strong>&nbsp;In November 2023, Harris’s team started looking into how AI could be used by recruiters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We started looking at the possibility of AI. And what we found was, when you look at the role of a recruiter and what they do, about 80% of our jobs were what you would hear in the conferences about the mundane tasks” that AI could replace, she told HR Brew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To help ease recruiters’ fear of being replaced by AI, Harris and her team experimented with AI with prompt-a-thons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zillow already used hackathons to develop consumer-facing features and products; Harris’s team adopted the practice for its internal AI use. For example, prompt-a-thon teams expressed a desire for more coaching on having difficult conversations with hiring managers. They devised a prompt that could be used on ChatGPT, including capturing details about the issue, as well as emphasizing soft skills like maintaining a rapport or trust with hiring managers. The result: solutions devised by recruiters themselves, not a top-down edict from leadership.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The problems that they would go to tackle were ones that, I think, if I had to put my leadership team in a room and say, ‘Let us go do this,’ we wouldn’t have come up with the same questions and challenges at all,” Harris said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After identifying the problems and solutions, Harris would bring in, what she called, the cavalry—the legal, enterprise tech, engagement and belonging, and TA teams—to assess the tools and determine usability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prompt-a-thons have so far resulted in six AI recruitment tools, Harris said. Some were developed in-house, but most are vendor tools that Harris’s team were either early adopters of or helped develop. Harris said she hasn’t yet been told “no” by the cavalry, largely because she has followed their best practices, such as avoiding decision-making tools and personal identifiers (like race, gender, or identifying keywords) to assess candidates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Luckily, I’ve been around for a while, and so has my leadership team. We kind of always knew we didn’t want AI to make decisions,” she said. “We stayed away from tools and things that did that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Measuring success.&nbsp;</strong>The tools used by Harris’s team focus both on assisting recruiters and improving the candidate experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job-seeker side, Zillow’s AI tools include assistants that help candidates find and apply to roles, and schedule and prepare for interviews. On the recruiter side, recruitment marketing software or <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/linkedin/\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn</a> Recruiter help source high-quality candidates, while another tool analyzes and provides feedback on interviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you’re applying to a job at Zillow, you can have assistance in helping you do that, and it’ll help match you to some roles as well. We also then use AI to help the recruiter,” Harris said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zillow’s AI-powered interview scheduler is intended to speed up hiring and alleviate recruiters’ workloads, which are huge; some roles, such as sales or marketing specialists, receive 4,000+ applications within a day of being posted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“As someone who started their career as a recruiting coordinator, I think it’s the scheduling tool that&#8217;s actually my favorite,” Harris said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Harris said recruiting coordinators would spend over a week coordinating schedules for interviews. Now, candidates receive a text or email with a link that shows the interviewer’s availability, and schedules a meeting, which has cut time spent scheduling an interview to 30 minutes—a 97% reduction saving recruiters as many as 450 hours per month.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For any recruiting coordinator sweating at the sight of that stat, Harris shared good news: “They’ve upgraded their skills. They all still work at Zillow.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many former coordinators now work in Zillow’s employee service center, or in executive assistant or program manager roles; others help manage the scheduling tool. (And, when the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.morningbrew.com/stories/aws-outage-brought-down-rest-of-the-internet\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">October AWS outage</a>&nbsp;crippled the internet, those former coordinators helped manually schedule interviews.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zillow has also leveraged AI to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2024/05/15/zillow-s-vp-of-talent-acquisition-engagement-and-belonging-says-her-work-with-the-real-estate-app-is-a-beautiful-intersection\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recruit candidates</a>&nbsp;from a wider geographic area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After embracing its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/07/02/zillow-ceo-remote-work-talent-recruiting-jeremy-wacksman/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">remote-first work model</a>, called Cloud HQ, Zillow found it wasn’t a well-known employer in some cities. Harris’s team used tools, including newsletters and targeted actions to drive applications, as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2025/09/03/linkedin-s-first-agent-hiring-assistant-expands-availability-globally-after-first-year\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">LinkedIn Recruiter</a>&nbsp;to save time sourcing better candidates, Appcast, a recruitment advertising technology provider that Zillow said helped recruit across regions. Using those three channels, 558 hires were made in 2025 through mid-December.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We had a reputation in those areas where we had offices. Well, when you flip that on the head and say, we’re going to be a Cloud HQ and we’re going to be able to hire across the country, we don&#8217;t have a reputation everywhere,” she said. “AI helped us build reputation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This report was <a href=\"https://www.hr-brew.com/stories/2026/01/06/how-zillow-uses-ai-hiring\">originally published</a> by </em><a href=\"https://www.hr-brew.com/\">HR Brew</a>.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/recruiters-fear-replaced-by-ai-zillow-prompt-a-thons-new-tools/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Shark Tank’s Kevin O’Leary isn’t used to taking orders, yet as an actor for the new movie <em>Marty Supreme</em>, the prolific investor had no other choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O’Leary has been a millionaire for more than 25 years and a prolific investor since then. He sold his software company SoftKey to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/mattel/\" target=\"_blank\">Mattel</a> for $4.2 billion in 1999. More recently, he has invested an estimated $8.5 million into about <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/31/kevin-oleary-worst-shark-tank-investment-ever-lost-half-a-million.html\">40 companies</a> in his role as a judge on <em>Shark Tank</em> since its inaugural 2009 season.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, on the set of Marty Supreme, where he played ruthless millionaire businessman Milton Rockwell opposite Timothée Chalamet’s character Marty Mauser, O’Leary learned that just because he calls the shots in every other aspect of his life, doesn’t mean he was holding the reins on set. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Minor to major spoilers follow for <em>Marty Supreme</em>.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I learned my lesson that film sets are not democracies. I’m not used to being told what to do. I do the telling,” O’Leary told <a href=\"https://variety.com/2026/film/news/kevin-oleary-marty-supreme-ending-rachel-die-1236623761/\"><em>Variety</em></a>. “We shot something 20 times and I said to Josh [Safdie], ‘OK, I think we got it. We can move on.’ He said, ‘What the f*** are you talking about? There’s no moving on until I say we’re moving on.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">O&#8217;Leary&#8217;s contributions to the film</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, although O’Leary was not in control on set, Safdie and co-writer Ronald Bronstein were happy to include his notes for a character that echoed some of his own personality. One of the most prominent was a monologue delivered by Rockwell to Mauser in which he claimed to be a “vampire” born in 1601.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O’Leary also contributed to Rockwell’s look, and leveraged his knowledge as a horophile when choosing the two watches his character wore on each wrist, one set for New York and the other for Tokyo time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>O’Leary refused to wear a prop watch or to wear a watch he didn’t own. Instead, he went on a global hunt for era-appropriate pieces to wear in the film.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He called up Rolex and secured a Patek Phillipe from the 1950’s which he admittedly purchased “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/shorts/qL5TZ1Rjc3Y\">at a crazy price.</a>” The other, a Seiko-made watch called “Super” from 1952 was impossible to find on the secondary market. In the end, “Seiko found one — it might have come from some museum — and they gifted it to me,” O’Leary told the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe one of O’Leary’s most memorable scenes was when he literally smacked the Oscar-nominated Chalamet on his bare butt with a real ping pong paddle in order to bring more authenticity to a pivotal scene that he said required 40 takes and took until 4 a.m. to finish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To be sure, one of his biggest qualms with the film was the ending, which wraps up poorly for his character, and which he called “absurd,” according to <em>Variety</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I had lots of fights with Ronnie [Bronstein]— well, not fights, but I said, ‘Guys, this <em>Marty Supreme</em> guy, I would never let anybody [expletive] me over like this. This would never happen to me, ever. And he is not paying an adequate price,’” O’Leary told the <em>New York Times</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yet, not all of the <em>Shark Tank</em> judge’s suggestions were incorporated into the final cut. Apparently, the investor and rookie actor suggested changes for the film’s ending, including that Chalamet’s character’s love interest, Rachel Mizler (played by Odessa A&#8217;zion) should die in childbirth in order to add more suffering to an otherwise “kumbaya” ending. In the end, Safdie considered the change but didn’t incorporate it as he thought it was too “sick,” according to <em>Variety</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A reluctant &#8220;employee&#8221;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>O’Leary is not used to being an employee.

      "content": "\n<p>Nearly one year into his tenure, San Francisco Mayor Daniel Lurie is offering a candid diagnosis of the city’s recent struggles: The municipal government became an adversary to the very economic engine it relied upon. Speaking at the <a href=\"https://conferences.fortune.com/event/brainstorm-ai-2025/HOME\">Fortune Brainstorm AI</a> conference in early December, Lurie admitted the city’s political class previously operated under the assumption businesses would tolerate endless hurdles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We took our business community for granted,&#8221; <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a7fhLLkttJw&amp;list=PLS8YLn_6PU1mFn2IfQ_CBvTvw35zMvDta&amp;index=7\">Lurie told <em>Fortune</em> Editorial Director Andrew Nusca</a>. &#8220;We said &#8216;We can just keep punishing you&#8230; and you&#8217;re going to stay.&#8217; Well that didn&#8217;t happen. People fled.&#8221; (<a href=\"https://www.sfchronicle.com/sf/article/sf-population-loss-19993542.php\">As of 2024</a>, San Francisco had lost people every year since 2020, with 2025 census data not available yet, but projected to have stabilized in the past year. Total net population loss is between 30,000 to 55,000, against a wider population of around 834,000.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The elected class in San Francisco took people for granted,&#8221; Lurie said, from its artists to its restaurants to its entrepreneurs. &#8220;We&#8217;re not going to do that again.&#8221;  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lurie, who noted City Hall historically functioned as &#8220;kind-of an opponent&#8221; to small businesses due to so much bureaucracy and red tape, is now attempting to reverse that dynamic by positioning the government as a partner. However, while the mayor was eager to modernize the city’s archaic infrastructure with Silicon Valley-style innovation, he explicitly rejected the tech industry’s famous mantra of &#8220;move fast and break things.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think we should be breaking things &#8230; in government,&#8221; Lurie cautioned. While acknowledging the city needs to adopt &#8220;tools that are well regarded,&#8221; he emphasized the implementation must always happen with safety and regulations in mind.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Safety first, innovation second</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This cautious but forward-looking approach is most visible in Lurie&#8217;s handling of public safety, which he identifies as his absolute priority. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Nothing else matters if you can&#8217;t keep people safe,&#8221; he said. To that end, the city has deployed new technologies, including drones as first responders and license plate readers, to track criminal activity without engaging in dangerous high-speed chases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The strategy appears to be yielding results. Lurie reported crime is down 30% citywide and 40% in the Financial District and Union Square. Furthermore, he noted the city is currently seeing its lowest homicide rate since the 1950s. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are an incredibly safe American city,&#8221; Lurie said, while noting there are still major issues to tackle, principally a &#8220;behavioral health crisis on our streets.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The battle against &#8216;red tape&#8217;</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A significant portion of Lurie’s &#8220;partner, not opponent&#8221; strategy involves dismantling the city’s notorious bureaucracy. He highlighted the absurdity of San Francisco’s governance structure, pointing out the city <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/sf-report-suggests-cutting-almost-half-of-city-commissions-but-streamlining-fight-over-isnt-over-yet/ar-AA1SyFkn\">maintains 150 commissions</a>—almost triple the number in Los Angeles, despite LA having ten times the population.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To streamline operations, the administration has launched &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.sf.gov/permitsf\">Permit SF</a>,&#8221; a digitization initiative aimed at replacing paper forms with a unified digital system. The goal is for business owners to fill out a single form that is routed to all necessary departments, rather than visiting separate windows for fire, planning, and health approvals.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Return to office: attraction over mandates</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Regarding the revitalization of downtown, Lurie said he&#8217;s taking a soft-power approach, including with regard to return to office. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My job as the mayor of San Francisco is not to tell people to be in the office five days a week,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s to create the condition so people <em>want</em> to be in the office.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He argued that by ensuring clean streets and reliable public transit, the city can naturally attract workers back, citing the seven-day-a-week office culture of major AI firms like Anthropic and OpenAI as evidence of the city’s returning energy, alluding to how <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/08/19/originated-in-china-the-996-schedule-of-working-9am-9pm-6-days-a-week-comes-to-silicon-valley/\">&#8220;996&#8221; culture</a> has spread across Silicon Valley.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Defining the narrative</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Ultimately, Lurie said he believes the city’s greatest challenge has been psychological—specifically, the &#8220;sentiment&#8221; of its own citizens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It seems like the biggest nut to crack was San Franciscans&#8217; opinion of themselves &#8230; you&#8217;ve got to love yourself before anyone else is going to love you,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said his overarching goal for his remaining three years in office is to restore San Francisco’s status as a &#8220;world-class city that is the envy of the world,&#8221; ensuring it is no longer defined by outside critics, but by its own residents.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is the greatest city in the world when we&#8217;re at our best,&#8221; Lurie said. &#8220;And I think people are starting to see that again.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/san-francisco-mayor-daniel-lurie-took-business-community-for-granted-people-fled/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Newly-inaugurated New York City Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s housing agenda is facing its first test as the city balks at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-29/bankrupt-nyc-rental-buildings-get-451-million-offer-from-summit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">bankruptcy sale</a>&nbsp;of thousands of rent-stabilized apartments owned by Pinnacle Group, where residents have railed against living conditions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>City authorities on Monday&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cases.stretto.com/public/x447/13780/PLEADINGS/1378001062680000000003.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">asked</a>&nbsp;a bankruptcy judge to delay a Chapter 11 auction scheduled for Thursday, saying they need more time to both evaluate a proposed $451 million deal to Summit Properties USA and “explore any potential alternatives.” After the buildings were put into bankruptcy last year, Summit offered to buy dozens of buildings in Brooklyn, Manhattan, Bronx and Queens in the form of a stalking horse bid, meaning the transaction is subject to potentially better offers at auction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advisers representing the bankrupt properties haven’t provided the city with information about Summit’s ability to consummate the proposed sale or whether it is willing and financially able to repair the buildings, New York City Corporate Counsel&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nyc.gov/site/law/careers/attorney-ambassador-profile.page?name=Muriel%20Goode-Trufant\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Muriel Goode-Trufant</a>&nbsp;said in a court filing. The Pinnacle-owned buildings owe the city $12.7 million for unpaid debts and housing violations, the city said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Completion of the bankruptcy auction process will bring financial stability along with the opportunity to stabilize services, outcomes which we would expect the City would not want to disrupt,” Pinnacle lawyer Ken Fisher said in an email. Summit didn’t immediately return a message Tuesday seeking comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge follows an assertion from Mamdani, just hours into his term as mayor, that the city would intervene in the bankruptcy to protect tenants. It foreshadows the 34-year-old’s ambitious plans after he campaigned with a relentless focus on affordability, particularly around housing, ahead of his ascent to chief overseer of the most populous city in the US.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Residents have dealt with a lack of heating, roaches and “the kind of conditions that no New Yorker should have to live through,” Mamdani&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvd6n9nfsP0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a>&nbsp;at a press conference after touring a Pinnacle-owned building in Brooklyn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A number of residents in Pinnacle buildings organized in response to what they have described in letters as “years of mismanagement and neglect” and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cases.stretto.com/public/x447/13780/PLEADINGS/1378012162580000000147.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">won support</a>&nbsp;from other elected city officials before Monday’s court filing. Pinnacle placed the buildings into Chapter 11 in May carrying more than $500 million in mortgage debt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our intervention in the Pinnacle case shows we are walking the walk, and fighting to ensure any outcome from this case improves living conditions and protects affordability for Pinnacle tenants,” said Cea Weaver of the Mayor’s Office to Protect Tenants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The city also raised concerns about the economics of the proposed deal on Monday, saying advisers overseeing the bankrupt Pinnacle buildings haven’t demonstrated the properties can support the proposed sale price or ongoing maintenance costs given that the apartments are rent-regulated. Advisers also haven’t provided New York City authorities with a comprehensive assessment on what repairs the buildings require, the city said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposed sale also wouldn’t result in “a supportable business” so-long as the bankrupt properties have rent-stabilized or rent controlled apartments because the current rents “are very low-averaging,” the city said in its court filing. That could mean that the task of addressing emergency repairs might fall upon New York City authorities or tenants themselves, or pressure residents to move out, the city said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Advisers have blamed the bankruptcy on rising interest rates and inflation-driven increases in operating expenses and lower rent collection. Tenants at multiple Pinnacle properties have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-09-15/nyc-rent-stabilized-buildings-struggle-under-rent-caps-and-rising-debts\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">told</a>&nbsp;Bloomberg News that the company has for years either failed or been slow to respond to requests for repairs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Summit owns a swath of properties, including regional malls as well as NYC apartments and office properties in Manhattan, according to the firm’s website. The proposed sale of the Pinnacle buildings must be approved by Judge David Jones, who is overseeing the bankruptcy case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Continuing losses and mounting expenses might lead to the need for additional bankruptcies or reorganizations, a state of financial and social chaos potentially worse than the current situation of the debtors themselves,” the city said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The case is Broadway Realty I Co. LLC, number 25-11050, in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/nyc-fights-sale-of-bankrupt-rentals-after-mamdani-blasts-living-conditions/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/why-tariffs-cut-inflation-san-francisco-federal-reserve-taxes-affordability/",
      "content": "\n<p>Tariffs are a tax on you, the consumer. That&#8217;s the undisputed fact about how tariffs function, with the levies falling on companies, which then typically pass a great percentage on to the final shopper. Voter anger about affordability built throughout 2025, culminating in offyear elections that swept Democrats such as New York City&#8217;s new Mayor Zohran Mamdani into office, prompting an angry President Trump to complain that affordability is a &#8220;hoax&#8221; when Democrats talk about it, as he&#8217;s vanquished inflation since coming into office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what if tariffs actually cut inflation instead?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The widely-held “cost-push” theory posits that tariffs drive up domestic production costs by making imported input more expensive. That entails a drop in economic activity and higher inflation in the short run.&nbsp;A new analysis from the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, an economic letter titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2026/01/what-can-history-tell-us-about-tariff-shocks/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.frbsf.org/research-and-insights/publications/economic-letter/2026/01/what-can-history-tell-us-about-tariff-shocks/\">What Can History Tell Us About Tariff Shocks?</a>&#8221; contradicts the longstanding economic consensus that tariffs raise inflation. In fact, it claims the opposite will result: higher tariffs will lead to lower inflation (and higher unemployment).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Our analysis of historical data highlights a possibility that the large tariff increase of 2025 could put upward pressure on unemployment while putting downward pressure on inflation,” authors Regis Barnichon and Aayush Singh said in the report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Prevailing wisdom has offered a pessimistic outlook on the state of the economy following President Donald Trump’s 15% increase in the average U.S. tariff rate last year, up from a rate of less than 3% at the end of 2024, a rate not matched since 1935, according to <a href=\"https://budgetlab.yale.edu/research/state-us-tariffs-november-17-2025\">Yale Budget Lab</a>. If accurate, the San Francisco Fed’s report offers a glimmer of hope that a tariff shock may not in fact increase inflation as much as some economists fear.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Uncertainty as a shock to demand</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The crux of the argument is that tariff shocks inspire economic uncertainty, a deflationary mechanism. The report finds that the prevailing belief that tariffs raise inflation fails to take into account the economic impact of uncertainty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A tariff shock tends to coincide with an uncertain economic environment, which by itself depresses economic activity by lowering consumers’ and investors’ confidence and puts downward pressure on inflation” the authors wrote.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article outlines a second explanation, explaining that a tariff shock could ignite a drop in asset prices, depressing overall demand, which increases unemployment and decreases inflation.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>History points to a deflationary effect</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Barnichon and Singh analyzed data between 1870 and 1913 as well as from the interwar period between WWI and WWII, the most recent examples of tariff volatility of this magnitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What their data revealed was “a strong negative correlation” between changes in tariffs and inflation. According to the data, a one percentage point increase in tariffs was associated with a 0.6 percentage point decline in inflation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Different era, different economy</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But the U.S. economy has evolved significantly since the early 20th century, as the authors note. “The share of imported inputs in production is higher today than in the past, which means a tariff shock may be more likely to raise inflation,” the authors note.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Import volume in 2024, before Trump enacted his tariffs, <a href=\"https://www.bea.gov/news/2025/us-international-trade-goods-and-services-december-and-annual-2024#:~:text=Imports%20of%20goods%20increased%20$187.1,Insurance%20services%20increased%20$11.5%20billion.\">totaled</a> about $3.2 trillion. For comparison, in 1929, the year before the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act was enacted, raising tariffs to about 20%, import volume stood at <a href=\"http://jstor.org/stable/2277196\">$4.4 billion</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Because many aspects of the economy were different a hundred or more years ago, those historical experiences may not fully apply to current conditions,” Barnichon and Singh said. For one, the last time tariffs of this magnitude were implemented was during the Great Depression, when unemployment <a href=\"https://www.stlouisfed.org/the-great-depression/curriculum/economic-episodes-in-american-history-part-3#:~:text=Gauging%20the%20Economic%20Impact,failed%20between%201930%20and%201933.\">reached</a> a peak of 25% and GDP fell by nearly 30%.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/why-tariffs-cut-inflation-san-francisco-federal-reserve-taxes-affordability/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/robots-advancing-from-backflips-to-opening-door-handles-skild-sequoia/",
      "content": "\n<p>While viral videos of robots performing parkour and backflips dominate social media feeds, industry insiders suggest these acrobatic feats are misleading indicators of progress. Industry executives at the <a href=\"https://conferences.fortune.com/event/brainstorm-ai-2025/websitePage:fb7af5b4-ecbf-45da-aa7b-b3106fa42d03\">Fortune Brainstorm AI</a> conference, held in early December in San Francisco, argued that the true revolution in robotics is not physical agility, but the ability for robots to &#8220;think&#8221; for themselves—a capability that is finally bringing them closer to conquering the mundane, yet deceptively difficult, task of, say, opening a door or climbing a set of stairs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the past 70 years, robotics relied on a specific paradigm: intelligent humans pre-programming machines with complex mathematics to execute specific tasks. This approach is now obsolete, argued Sequoia Capital partner <a href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/people/stephanie-zhan/\">Stephanie Zhan</a> and Skild AI CEO <a href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-skild/\">Deepak Pathak</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gyw7zVmkMq8&amp;list=PLS8YLn_6PU1mFn2IfQ_CBvTvw35zMvDta&amp;index=6\">in conversation with <em>Fortune</em>&#8216;s Allie Garfinkle</a>. The industry is undergoing a massive shift where robots, much like the Large Language Models (LLMs) behind tools like ChatGPT, are learning directly from data and experience rather than following rigid code. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The change is things in robotics used to be driven more by human intelligence,&#8221; said Pathak, noting that the new wave is defined by models that can generalize and learn. &#8220;What has now changed is that these models or these robots can now can learn from data.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In July 2024, Zhan wrote for <a href=\"https://sequoiacap.com/article/partnering-with-skild/\">Sequoia&#8217;s blog</a> about Pathak&#8217;s deep credentials in the space and what distinguishes him as a robotics CEO: his computer vision and deep learning chops. In comparison, traditional robotics focused on collecting specific data to train robots for particular tasks. Pathak and his partner, Abhinav Gupta, leveraged large-scale data to build a foundation model. Hailing from a small town in India, Pathak made national headlines by gaining acceptance into the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur without leaving his rural hometown, Zhan wrote. He learned to program by writing code by hand at home and used limited minutes at the local cafe to run his programs. He later pursued a Ph.D. in AI at Berkeley while joining Facebook AI Research, on the way to co-founding Skild.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Zhan and Pathak&#8217;s conversation with Garfinkle touched on a paradox in artificial intelligence known as <a href=\"https://lhra.io/blog/ai-concepts-moravecs-paradox-care/\">Moravec’s paradox</a>: what looks hard is often easy, and what looks easy is incredibly hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why backflips are easier than doors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A robot doing a backflip essentially requires controlling its own body in free space, a physics problem that computers have been good at solving for decades. &#8220;It&#8217;s actually a lot easier to program a robot to do a backflip than it is to get them to climb stairs,&#8221; Garfinkle pointed out, to agreement from both of her panelists.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The real challenge—and the holy grail of &#8220;physical intelligence&#8221;—lies in interaction with the chaotic real world. Climbing stairs or picking up a glass requires a robot to continuously use vision to correct its movements in response to a changing environment. This &#8220;sensory motor common sense&#8221; is the root of human general intelligence, and it is the barrier that new &#8220;brain&#8221; software is attempting to break.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors and executives see this as a market opportunity comparable to the recent explosion in generative AI. Zhan noted that just as OpenAI unlocked the market for digital knowledge work, companies like Pathak&#8217;s Skild are aiming to unlock the market for all physical labor. The goal is to create &#8220;generally intelligent software&#8221; that can act as a brain for any robot hardware, reducing costs by an order of magnitude.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Unlike the software world, however, robotics faces a unique hurdle: a lack of data. While LLMs were trained on the entire internet, there is no equivalent database for robot physical interactions. Pathak argued that the company that deploys first will win by creating a &#8220;data flywheel,&#8221; in which field robots generate the data needed to make the system smarter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For consumers wondering when a robot will be doing their laundry, the timeline remains staged. Pathak and Zhan predicted that robots will first proliferate in industrial settings and &#8220;semi-structured&#8221; environments like hotels and hospitals before entering the more chaotic environment of a private home.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite fears of job displacement, they argued that the technology is necessary to address the &#8220;Three S&#8217;s&#8221; of the future: Safety, Shortages, and Social evolution. Robots are poised to take over jobs that currently force humans to risk their lives or health. Furthermore, with millions of job openings currently unfilled due to labor shortages, robots could fill the gap in essential blue-collar work. Ultimately, the hope is for a social shift where dangerous or drudge work becomes optional, allowing humans to focus on tasks they enjoy.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/robots-advancing-from-backflips-to-opening-door-handles-skild-sequoia/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "title": "Why one of the world’s most qualified chief design officers calls Samsung his ‘dream job’",
      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/samsung-chief-design-officer-mauro-porcini-dream-job/",
      "content": "\n<p>Mauro Porcini, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/samsung-electronics/\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a> Electronics’ first-ever chief design officer, sees his path leading design at some of the world’s largest companies as something close to a calling.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It felt like faith, God, or whatever you believe in, was looking down and saying ‘Wait a second, before going after your dream, you need to prepare yourself. You need to be ready,’” Porcini says in his office at Samsung’s R&amp;D center near Seoul’s lively Gangnam district. “I needed to get ready for probably my dream job: Being in tech, in a world where tech is about to completely change the way we live.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Porcini feels slightly out-of-place in the Korean <em>chaebol’s </em>offices. Hailing from Gallarate, a small town outside of Milan, Porcini wears plaid trousers with white racing stripes down the side, platform boots, and a beige jacket with a red lapel, quite different from the more plainly-dressed Korean designers and office workers that sit at Samsung’s desks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For decades, Samsung, maker of consumer electronics like smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and refrigerators, relied on its vast internal design workforce to become a brand rivaling <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/apple/\" target=\"_blank\">Apple</a> in prestige. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But renewed competition now threatens to unseat the Global 500 manufacturer from its place at the top of the consumer electronics market. Apple likely overtook Samsung to become the No. 1 smartphone seller in 2025 for the first time in over a decade, according to <a href=\"https://counterpointresearch.com/en/insights/Global-Smartphone-Forecast-for-2025\">Counterpoint Research</a>, a market intelligence firm. And up-and-coming Chinese firms like <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/xiaomi/\" target=\"_blank\">Xiaomi</a> (for phones) and TCL (for TVs) are starting to encroach on Samsung’s premium markets. Then add AI, which threatens to shake up what smart devices can do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung has thus turned to an outsider—Porcini—and asked him use his approach to design to help the Korean company to better compete with its rivals&nbsp;“How can we evolve our portfolio to be as meaningful as possible to people and to the business? This is the overall mission.” Porcini asks. “How can we create the best possible products? What is their identity? How do people interact with them?&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a continued bet on design from the Global 500 company, even as cost pressures and new technologies could limit the corporate appetite for expensive human designers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A career of firsts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Porcini could, arguably, be called the most qualified corporate designer in business today. Few others have worked at so many Fortune Global 500 companies: <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/3m/\" target=\"_blank\">3M</a> (No. 489), <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/pepsico/\" target=\"_blank\">PepsiCo</a> (No. 115), and now Samsung (No. 27).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2011, he took over design responsibilities at 3M, where he fought to make aesthetics part of the product process. “If I was making beautiful and functional products in ugly packaging, or if the experience in retail or digital was wrong, we were going to go nowhere,” he recalls. Porcini went into the field: “It wasn’t easy, because it wasn’t in my job description,” he says. “I needed to step on the toes of so many people.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year later, PepsiCo tapped him to be its first-ever head of design. “Industrial designers in tech, historically, focus on the product,” he says. “What I learned in consumer packaged goods was the importance of the overall experience with the brand.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both 3M and PepsiCo gave Porcini an appreciation for what non-designers bring to the conversation. “The ideal configuration is one where you have designers coming in with a human-centric approach, you have marketing coming in with a business perspective, and R&amp;D coming in with a technology perspective,” he says.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>A return to tech roots</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung is a return, of sorts, for Porcini. The designer wrote his master’s thesis on wearables, foreseeing how smart clothing and other technologies could become part of daily life even before wireless technologies like Wifi and Bluetooth were standard. And when Porcini brought PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi around the world to look at leaders in design, he made sure to make a stop at Samsung.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We came all the way to Seoul in 2013 to meet the top management of Samsung and really understand how it was investing in design,” he remembers. Porcini highlights two lessons he learned from Samsung: A constant push to reinvent and revitalize its products, and “uniting the entire organization around one design mission.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That forward-thinking approach can be attributed to late chairman Lee Kun-Hee, who pushed Samsung,&nbsp;one of the mega-conglomerates or <em>chaebols </em>that dominate South Korea’s economy, to ditch its reputation as a fast follower and compete with the best companies in consumer tech. In his 1993 “Frankfurt Declaration,” Lee urged executives to “change everything except your wife and children.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Lee understood design’s power in digital technology,” says Youngjin Yoo, a professor at the London School of Economics and former Samsung adviser.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung designers studied how people interacted with devices; for example, consumers keep their TVs off for most of the day; they&#8217;re more like a piece of furniture than a source of entertainment. Samsung treated the television as the centerpiece to a room, a philosophy the company continues today with screens that could pass for art when not in use. (Porcini, during our conversation, points to what looks like a reproduction of Salvador Dali’s “The Persistence of Memory” behind him. “Did you know that’s a TV?” he says.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What Samsung did with the Bespoke line of refrigerators [a fully customizable model] and other categories was pretty brave,” Porcini says. “We need to double down on what the company is already doing, and take it to the next level.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Samsung is dogged by accusations that it copies its competition. Apple sued Samsung in 2011 for allegedly infringing its design patents; the two giants <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/world/apple-samsung-settle-us-patent-dispute-idUSKBN1JN2UA/\">settled their long legal feud</a> in 2018.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yoo thinks the company lost momentum after the 2016 Galaxy Note 7 crisis, when exploding batteries forced a massive recall. “Samsung could have continued to innovate. But I think they stalled in a way,” he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, Samsung needs to grapple with how to integrate AI into its smart products, which don’t seem quite as smart as they used to in an age of LLMs and AI agents. Yet companies large and small have yet to crack the code on how to make a truly AI-enabled device. Early experiments,&nbsp;like the Humane AI pin, have <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/02/20/the-downfall-of-ai-startup-humane-reveals-the-perils-of-the-ai-race/\">flopped</a> due to high prices and poor performance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Samsung is aggressively pushing its AI across its products, with Samsung Electronics co-CEO Roh Tae-moon promising to get its Galaxy AI services onto 800 million mobile devices this year. &#8220;We will apply AI to all products, all functions, and all services as quickly as possible,&#8221; he told Reuters in an <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/china/samsung-double-mobile-devices-powered-by-googles-gemini-800-mln-units-this-year-2026-01-05/\">early January interview</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Design’s value in the age of AI</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI also poses a threat to designers. Generative AI could be a hugely useful tool for creatives, allowing them to mock up and refine ideas much more quickly and at much lower costs. But AI could also automate their work, which could threaten jobs as companies pay closer attention to costs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That’s partly why Porcini sees his appointment as Samsung’s chief design officer as a rare bit of good news for corporate design. “When I announced my appointment on Linkedin, and I saw hundreds of thousands of impressions … so many designers around the world saw this as hope,” he says. “I felt the pressure. Now I need to deliver, right?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, he’s optimistic that AI will, in fact, reinforce the value that human designers can bring to companies. “Eventually, AI and robots will become a commodity,” he suggests. “Technology is a tool.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And “in an age of extreme technology, businesses need the best humans more than ever,” he says. “Designers are the ambassadors for human beings. And creating value for humans is one of the most powerful competitive advantages you can build at a company.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/samsung-chief-design-officer-mauro-porcini-dream-job/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

But one of the world’s most prolific entrepreneurs, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/berkshire-hathaway/\">Berkshire Hathaway</a>’s <a href=\"https://fortune.com/tag/warren-buffett/\">Warren Buffett</a>, says glitzy compensation packages shouldn’t be their aim.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his parting words as CEO last year, the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/oracle/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle</a> of Omaha reflected on his eight-decade career, and shared one lesson for Gen Zers kickstarting their professional lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Don’t worry too much about starting salaries and be very careful who you work for because you will take on the habits of the people around you,” Buffett <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/30/simon-sinek-says-prioritize-mentorship-over-salary-early-career-advice/\">warned the next generation of workers during</a> his final <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/berkshire-hathaway/\" target=\"_blank\">Berkshire Hathaway</a> annual shareholder meeting. “There are certain jobs you shouldn’t take.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The 95-year-old hedge fund mogul has decades worth of experience to draw upon; he’s led the iconic $1 trillion holding company for more than five decades as both CEO and chairman, before <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/30/warren-buffett-steps-down-ceo-keeps-coming-to-office-berkshire-hathaway/\">stepping down at</a> the start of this year as <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/meet-greg-abel-new-ceo-of-berkshire-hathaway-billionaire-boomer-start-in-business-selling-empty-soda-bottles/\">Greg Abel takes the reins</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But his career didn’t start off on such a lucrative high. The billionaire’s <a href=\"https://fortune.com/article/billionaire-warren-buffett-best-career-advice-gen-z-pick-the-right-people-make-first-million/\">first jobs were selling</a> Coke bottles door-to-door, and delivering newspapers for <em>The Washington Post </em>at just 13. After college, Buffett stepped into the corporate world, landing a gig at his dad’s brokerage firm Buffett-Falk &amp; Co., and working as a securities analyst for Graham-Newman Corp.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking back, Buffett shared the importance of getting on with the five bosses he served under in those early years—and he advises young professionals to find the same, since it can have an enormous ripple effect on the rest of their career and progression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you find people that are wonderful to work with, that’s the place to go,” Buffett continued. “Don’t expect that you’ll make every decision right on that, but you are going to have your life progress in the general direction of the people that you work with, that you admire, that become your friends.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Buffett’s other career advice for Gen Z: Hang out with people better than you and hone your strengths</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Buffett has lived out an enviable career. Thanks to his odd jobs early in life and appreciation for entrepreneurship, he rose to millionaire status at the age of 32 (equal to around $10 million in riches today). And for the next six decades, he continued to triumph in business, becoming the world’s richest person in 2008, and scaling his fortune to an eye-watering $150 billion. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite his string of impressive accomplishments, Buffett still manages to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/05/03/warren-buffett-advice-young-investors-life-lessons-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting/\">surround himself with</a> people who are excelling beyond him in other ways—and that, he says, is a key to success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s better to hang out with people better than you,” Buffett <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/05/03/warren-buffett-advice-young-investors-life-lessons-berkshire-hathaway-annual-meeting/\">continued</a> in Berkshire Hathaway’s annual shareholder meeting last year. “Pick out associates whose behavior is better than yours, and you’ll drift in that direction.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Gen Zers wanting to hit millionaire status or lead a successful career, Buffett laid out a simple plan of action. The self-made entrepreneur emphasized the importance of pinpointing what skills they’re actually good at, and going all in—even if slipups happen along the way. Having a strong support system will help professionals reach their biggest potential.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Figure out what your strengths are and then pick the right people and don’t be afraid of making mistakes,” Buffett <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cbssundaymorning/reel/DGqR78rOelc/\">told <em>CBS News</em></a> last year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Buffett’s advice may seem easier said than done—and the career woes that come with brutal job markets and economic downturns aren&#8217;t lost on the businessman. But he still thinks the best path for Gen Z is finding jobs (and bosses) they love, for a sustainable career. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2) with the kind of people they would select, if they had no need for money,” Buffett wrote in a <a href=\"https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/2021ltr.pdf\">2021 letter</a> to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. “Economic realities, I acknowledge, may interfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sort of job, they will no longer be &#8216;working.’”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/warren-buffett-left-berkshire-hathaway-job-parting-lesson-gen-z-workers-who-you-work-with-matters-more-than-salary/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

Our recent buyside discussions make it clear that the institutional market will be selective but look to put more capital to work behind their best ideas and grow with their winners. <em>—Seth Rubin, Stifel head of global equity capital markets</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the U.S./U.K. IPO markets are showing early signs of reawakening, optimism will remain measured. The opening of the IPO market will be a very significant event. The backlog is large and a positive trigger is needed to jumpstart the process of companies going public. <em>—Ivan Nikkhoo, managing partner, Navigate Ventures</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The IPO market will see more high-end, big-name companies go public as valuations improve, while smaller issuers will continue to struggle until meaningful reforms make the process more efficient and cost-effective. <em>—Brad Bernstein, managing partner, FTV Capital</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We expect 2026 to bring robust crypto-asset dealmaking generally, including M&amp;A activity in the prediction markets and IPOs, as well as public tokenization transactions if we receive some helpful relief from the SEC on them. <em>—Ben Cohen, partner, Latham &amp; Watkins</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With a choppy IPO window, [in life sciences] later-stage companies are staying private longer and often running dual-track M&amp;A/go-public processes. Expect sustained high levels of activity in biotech and oncology sectors, both in earlier and later stage assets. <em>—Mike Patrone, technology, life sciences, and private equity partner, Goodwin</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mergers and acquisitions</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A $50B+ AI software acquisition reshapes the market. As a friendly regulatory environment continues and the financing capacity of incumbents grows—especially if they pull back from hyperscaler spending and free up tens of billions of dollars—I predict we’ll see a $50B+ AI software acquisition. <em>—Jai Das, cofounder, president and partner, Sapphire Ventures</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The deal environment will be more active, but larger buyout deals will likely be episodic and highly competitive.<em>—Luke Sarsfield, CEO, P10&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2026, fintech will enter a phase defined by consolidation. The companies that achieve real product–market fit, strong unit economics, and defensible data advantages will pull decisively ahead, either by acquiring smaller players. <em>—Ben Borodach, cofounder and CEO, April</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we’ll see a lot of AI investment to help loss-related activities (FNOL, fraud detection, etc.). We’ll also continue to see private equity go after insurance distribution as a target sector while carriers keep snapping up inventive/creative new underwriters. <em>—David Seider, CCO, TheZebra.com</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>2026 will mark the year of biotech coming back in vogue. Big pharma, with over $1 trillion in cash, will make significant acquisitions of venture-backed biotech companies focused on best-in-class therapies in oncology and metabolic diseases. <em>—Steven Yang, head of global venture investments, Schroders</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cross border M&amp;A as a percentage of global deal volumes is near a five-year high despite the trade wars and deglobalization headlines. Japan, which is undergoing an economic revitalization, will continue to shine under its new prime minister, Sanae Takaichi, corporate governance reforms and increasing interest from corporates and sponsors alike. <em>—Michal Katz, head of investment and corporate banking, Mizuho Americas</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>M&amp;A activity will remain robust, but the exit environment for the high multiple investments made in 2019 and 2021 will still be difficult. <em>—Eric Zinterhofer, founding partner, Searchlight Capital Partners</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venture capital-backed startups will start to merge, making unlikely partners of firms who typically compete for deals. This trend, which started with a trickle in 2025, will accelerate as startups look for ways to sustain growth and achieve scale for a potential public listing or PE exit&nbsp; <em>—Arvind Purushotham, head of Citi Ventures</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Secondaries, tenders, and more</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A defining trend for 2026 will be the rise of secondary markets in private investing. As startups remain private longer and traditional IPOs become less frequent, investors are increasingly seeking liquidity solutions through GP-led continuation vehicles, structured secondaries, and other private-market mechanisms. <em>—Kal Amin, managing partner, 1848 Ventures</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite our belief that liquidity will return to private equity in 2026, we see the secondary market achieving a new transaction volume high in 2026 after the record volume seen in 2025. Why? Because we believe that as distributions come in so will capital calls, leaving many LPs still overallocated to private equity for a period to come. And that LPs will be more active in how they manage their private equity portfolios in good times and bad. Thus, we predict the secondary market will reach $250B in volume in 2026. <em>—Yann Robard, managing partner, Dawson Partners</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The secondary markets will get noisy. The ongoing IPO drought will collide with the boom in registered alternatives, further accelerating the expansion of the secondary market<em>—</em>institutional capital is still at the wheel as new retail capital steps on the gas. Get ready to compare notes on private company valuations at the neighborhood block party as premiums rise, positions change hands more rapidly, and a “hot potato” environment introduces new structural risk. <em>—Larry Aschebrook, founder and managing partner, G Squared</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2026, tender offers won’t be limited to the largest private companies. As talent competition intensifies and employees grow impatient with illiquidity, mid-stage companies will use tenders as a core morale and retention lever. Following the lead of ElevenLabs and Temporal, you’ll see more companies openly announce tenders as predictable liquidity becomes a competitive advantage.<em> —Nick Bunick, principal, NewView Capital</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the economy growing at a somewhat surprisingly solid pace and inflation remaining elevated, the Fed has little reason – let alone urgency – to further cut rates. That means policy is unlikely to loosen much in the near term, keeping rates higher than many expected and possibly disappointing investors, unless inflation drops sharply or the job weakens unexpectedly. <em>—Dr. Lindsey Piegza, Stifel chief economist</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>See you tomorrow,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Allie Garfinkle<br>X:</strong> <a href=\"https://x.com/agarfinks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">@agarfinks</a><br><strong>Email:</strong> <a href=\"mailto:alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com\">alexandra.garfinkle@fortune.com</a><br>Submit a deal for the Term Sheet newsletter <a href=\"mailto:termsheet@fortune.com\">here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><em>Joey Abrams curated the deals section of today’s newsletter</em>.</em> <a href=\"https://fortune.com/newsletters/term-sheet\">Subscribe here</a>.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/crystal-ball-how-ipos-and-dealmaking-will-shake-out-in-2026/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>DoorDash&#8217;s CEO has slammed social media claims that a food delivery service is rating its drivers based on their &#8220;desperation&#8221; for work, saying he would fire any individual who thought that was acceptable. <br><br>The co-founder and CEO of San Francisco-based <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/doordash/\" target=\"_blank\">DoorDash</a> shared a screenshot of an unverified <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/confession/comments/1q1mzej/im_a_developer_for_a_major_food_delivery_app_the/\">Reddit post</a> made four days ago, in which an anonymous user claiming to be a developer for a food delivery company makes allegations about internal practices.<br><br>The legitimacy of the post is up for debate: Having gone somewhat viral on the social media platform, it was then <a href=\"https://www.platformer.news/fake-uber-eats-whisleblower-hoax-debunked/\">declared a hoax</a> by tech and democracy site Platformer. But by then, it had already garnered the attention and denunciation of one of the CEOs leading the pack in the food delivery space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Reddit user claimed an unnamed delivery service holds weekly meetings in which product managers discuss how to squeeze more out of &#8220;human assets&#8221;—their delivery drivers. &#8220;They talk about these people like they are resource nodes in a video game, not fathers and mothers trying to pay rent,&#8221; the post claims.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The user, who said they had recently quit their role and made the post on a burner laptop from a public library, alleges drivers are given a &#8220;desperation score&#8221; depending on their behavior at work. The hidden metric supposedly flags drivers who accept low-value &#8220;garbage&#8221; orders without hesitation, and then prevents them from viewing higher-paying orders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other unverified claims include that priority orders are no faster than timings on what were previously standard orders—regular orders were simply slowed down by five to 10 minutes so that priority seemed quicker by contrast. The post also alleges that the wording for a driver &#8220;benefit fee&#8221; is kept deliberately vague, so that users believe they are helping drivers when in fact the money is funnelled into a &#8220;corporate slush fund.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The post, which ends: &#8220;I&#8217;m drunk and I&#8217;m angry,&#8221; caught the attention of DoorDash&#8217;s Tony Xu. On <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">X</a>, Xu reposted a screenshot of the thread captioned &#8220;holy fucking shit.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Xu replied: &#8220;Holy fucking shit is right!

      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/trump-trade-tariffs-revenue-inflation-stocks/",
      "content": "\n<p>When the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href=\"https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category-line-chart.htm\">reported</a> that its most recent measure of consumer price inflation was just 2.7%, it came as a surprise to many. The <a href=\"https://think.ing.com/articles/tame-us-inflation-gives-the-fed-room-for-more-cuts/\">consensus prediction</a> on Wall Street had been 3.1%.<br><br>Ever since President Donald Trump announced his Liberation Day tariffs last April, economists have been expecting the extra cost of those tariffs to show up in the inflation numbers. After all, the effective tariff rate on goods imported from China was as high as 57.6% in November 2025, <a href=\"https://www.piie.com/research/piie-charts/2019/us-china-trade-war-tariffs-date-chart\">according to the Peterson Institute for International Economics</a>. <br><br>Surely this would force up the price of goods for consumers? <br><br>Nope, according to two new studies. Historically, tariffs haven&#8217;t resulted in big bursts of inflation, <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/economy/do-tariffs-cause-inflation-new-studies-offer-surprising-answer-20d56367?mod=hp_lead_pos11\">the studies from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco and Northwestern University show</a>. That’s because importing companies tend to find ways around the tariffs, or because countries negotiate enough compromises and exemptions to the tariffs to reduce the headline rate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both studies showed tariffs hurt economic growth and increase unemployment. But in terms of inflation, they were more benign than expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In fact, U.S. government revenue from Trump’s tariffs is already in decline, according to a research note from Pantheon Macroeconomics on Tuesday. That suggests their effect on inflation will get weaker as time goes by. Tariff revenues peaked at $34.2 billion in October and then declined to $32.9 billion in November and $30.2 billion in December, Pantheon’s data shows.</p>\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" data-src=\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-at-103309.png?w=1024&#038;h=645\" alt=\"\" class=\"lazyload wp-image-4391706\" src=\"https://fortune.com/img-assets/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/Screenshot-2026-01-06-at-103309.png?w=1024&#038;h=645\" width=\"1024\" height=\"645\" original-width=\"1921\" original-height=\"1210\"></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>“The latest trade data still are only for September, but sensible projections for recent months suggest the average effective tariff rate is about 12%, still well below the levels estimated by independent fiscal watchdogs,” analysts Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen told their clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They estimate that the effect on &#8220;Personal Consumption Expenditures&#8221; (PCE) inflation will only be about 0.9 percentage points, of which companies will eat 0.3. &#8220;Our calculations suggest 0.4pp of this uplift had filtered through by September, so the tariff hit is now mostly behind us. Core PCE inflation, therefore, likely will be within touching distance of the 2% target later this year.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Good for inflation, bad for debt</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The paucity of tariff revenue has knock-on effects for the U.S. government’s ability to tackle its debt. As the Pantheon note says, “Revenues also are tracking well below the White House’s expectations; Treasury Secretary Bessent predicted in August that tariffs will raise ‘…well over half a trillion, maybe towards a trillion-dollar number.’”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Independent research shows the tariffs have thus far come in far below that level. The <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/explainer/tariff-tracker/\">Bipartisan Policy Center estimates</a> that tariffs raised $288 billion in 2025. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/interactives/2025/trump-tariff-income-tracker/\">Politico puts it at</a> $261 billion. The <a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/B235RC1Q027SBEA\">St. Louis Fed tracker</a> shows $331 billion was collected from all production, imports, and customs taxes in Q3 2025, and that growth in those collections was slowing from the previous period. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The government’s <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/venezuela-trump-action-national-debt-economist-reaction/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks\">cumulative deficit for the fiscal year 2026</a> (which began in October) is already $439 billion, according to the <a href=\"https://bipartisanpolicy.org/report/deficit-tracker/\">Bipartisan Policy Centre</a>. The total national debt currently exceeds $38.5 trillion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has already spent part of the tariff revenue on a $1,776 “warrior dividend” for 1.45 million U.S. military personnel, prior to the Christmas holidays.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decline in revenue also has implications for the <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/12/05/trump-accounts-free-money.html\">$1,000 “Trump accounts”</a> that the president wants to give children and the undelivered suggestion that he might also give every citizen a $2,000 bonus from the tariffs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Treasury yields—which measure the premium investors demand for running the risk of lending money to the U.S. government—have ticked up in the last three months. The <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US5Y\">yield on the 5-year Treasury</a> rose from a low of 3.55% to 3.727% today. The <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/quotes/US10Y\">yield on the 10-year</a> rose from a low of 3.95% to 4.187% today. Those increases imply marginally increasing scepticism among investors about the ability of the government to fund its debts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stock investors, however, appear to be very happy about the lack of inflation and the apparent lower risk of future inflation. The S&amp;P 500 closed up 0.64% yesterday, within less than 1% of its all-time high. Futures were flat this morning. Europe and Asia traded up this morning and Bitcoin appears to be holding its own at above $93K.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Here’s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>S&amp;P 500 futures</strong> were up flat this morning.

      "content": "\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>In today’s CEO Daily:</strong> Diane Brady interviews GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The big story:</strong> Is Greenland next? </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The markets:</strong> Mostly up, with large gains again in Asia. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Plus:</strong> All the news and watercooler chat from <em>Fortune</em>.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Good morning.</strong> Of all the turnarounds in the past several years, few rival what Larry Culp managed to do for <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/\" target=\"_blank\">General Electric</a>. Tapped as the<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianebrady/2023/09/08/inside-the-new-ge-with-ceo-larry-culp/\"> first outsider</a> to run GE in late 2018, Culp split the moribund conglomerate into three<a href=\"https://fortune.com/ranking/fortune500/\"> Fortune 500</a> public companies:<a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/ge-healthcare-technologies/\"> GE HealthCare Technologies</a>,<a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/gevernova/\"> GE Vernova</a> and<a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/general-electric/\"> GE Aerospace</a>. The first to spin off was GE HealthCare, which went public on the<a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/nasdaq/\"> Nasdaq</a> exchange on Jan. 4, 2023. Since then, its stock is up almost 50%. (GE Vernova is up 400% since its April 2024 debut, thanks in large part to AI-driven electricity demand, while GE Aerospace has more than doubled.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I recently spoke with GE HealthCare CEO Peter J. Arduini about how he’s been forging a new chapter for the $20 billion-a-year medical technology and digital health company while drawing on GE’s legacy. Arduini spent much of his early career at GE under the leadership of Jack Welch and then Jeff Immelt, leaving in 2005 before Culp wooed him back.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Our conversation reminded me why GE was revered for much of its 133-year history. This was the company that Thomas Edison built, with a management system so potent that investors once believed it could be applied to light bulbs, nuclear reactors, <em>Saturday Night Live</em> and its opaque GE Capital finance arm with equal results. At its peak in 2000, GE’s market cap hovered around $600 billion, more than $1 trillion in today’s dollars. Then came the dot-com crash, 9/11, the Enron scandal, and the 2008 financial crisis, not to mention some fumbles under <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-09-16/ges-jeff-immelt-his-own-man\">Immelt</a>, who never managed to recreate the aura of his predecessor. The gold standard for global leadership was deemed too big to manage and broken up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Arduini has tried to revive much of what made GE special, from how it developed people to how it produced products. “The GE model was really stellar, and, honestly, prior to Larry coming back, some of that had dissolved. We didn’t even really do performance reviews in the same way and he brought that back,” said Arduini. “I tried to take the GE of old and took what was really good: how we think about our distribution of leadership, how we actually talk about leader development, how we build out our own Crotonville virtual university of development.”&nbsp;That said, he doesn’t yearn to be part of the behemoth he left behind. “When you’re in a larger business, in many cases, decisions take longer. And focus matters in our business. It is all about signal to noise; you want more signal, less noise. In a larger company, there has to be a little bit more noise.”<a href=\"https://fortune.com/article/ge-healthcare-ceo-peter-arduini-new-chapter-jack-welch-legacy/\"> Click here for the full interview.</a><br><br><em>Contact CEO Daily via Diane Brady at <a href=\"mailto:diane.brady@fortune.com\">diane.brady@fortune.com</a></em></p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/ge-healthcare-ceo-peter-arduini-interview-ge-legacy/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok has been accused of generating non-consensual sexualized images of real people, including children. Over the past week, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">X</a> has been flooded with manipulated photos that remove people’s clothes, dress them in bikinis, or rearrange them into sexually suggestive positions.<br><br>The nonconsensual images have left some women feeling violated. Meanwhile, their creation using Grok and their presence on X may land Musk&#8217;s company in significant legal trouble in several countries around the world.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ashley St. Clair, a conservative political commentator, social media influencer, and mother of one of Musk’s children (Musk has <a href=\"https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1906798844349718867\">questioned his paternity</a>), said that she became a victim of Grok’s “undressing&#8221; spree in recent days.&nbsp;<em>Fortune</em> has reviewed several examples of the images created on X, including fake images of St. Clair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“When I saw [the images], I immediately replied and tagged Grok and said I don&#8217;t consent to this,” St. Clair told <em>Fortune </em>in an interview on Monday.<em> </em>“[Grok] noted that I don&#8217;t consent to these images being produced…and then it continued producing the images, and they only got more explicit.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“There were pictures of me with nothing covering me except a piece of floss with my toddler&#8217;s backpack in the background and photos of me where it looks like I&#8217;m not wearing a top at all,” she said. &#8220;I felt so disgusted and violated. I also felt so angry that there were other women and children that this had been happening to.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>St. Clair told <em>Fortune </em>that after speaking out publicly about the situation she had been contacted by multiple other women who had had similar experiences, that she had reviewed inappropriate images of minors created by Grok, and was considering legal action over the images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Representatives for X did not immediately respond to <em>Fortune</em>’s request for comment. In a post on X, Musk said: &#8220;Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>X&#8217;s <a href=\"https://x.com/Safety/status/2007648212421587223?s=20\">official &#8220;Safety&#8221; account</a> said in a post Saturday that &#8220;We take action against illegal content on X, including Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM), by removing it, permanently suspending accounts, and working with local governments and law enforcement as necessary,&#8221; and included links to its policy and help pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Regulators launch investigations</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AI generated images and AI altered images, which have become widespread and easy to create thanks to new tools from companies including XAI, OpenAI, and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/\" target=\"_blank\">Google</a>, are raising concerns about misinformation, privacy, harassment, and other types of abuse. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the U.S. does not currently have a federal law regulating AI (and where President Trump&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/11/tech/ai-trump-states-executive-order\">recent executive order</a> has sought to curtail state and local laws), controversial use and misuse of the technology may pressure lawmakers to act. The situation is also likely to test existing laws, like Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which shields online providers from liability for content created by users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Riana Pfefferkorn, a policy fellow at the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence, said the legal liability surrounding AI-generated images is still murky, but will likely be tested in court in the near future. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a difference between a digital platform and a tool set,&#8221; she told <em>Fortune</em>. &#8220;By and large, [platforms] have immunity for the actions of their users online. But we&#8217;re in this evolving area where we don&#8217;t have court decisions yet on whether the output of generative AI is just third party speech that the platform cannot be held liable for, or whether it is the platform&#8217;s own speech, in which case there is no immunity.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We have this situation where for the first time, it is the platform itself that is at scale generating non-consensual pornography of adults and minors alike,&#8221; Pfefferkorn said. &#8220;From a liability perspective as well as a PR perspective, the CSAM laws pose the biggest potential liability risk here.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Regulators in other countries, meanwhile, have begun reacting to the recent spate of sexualized AI images. In the UK, Ofcom, the country’s independent regulator for the communications industries, said it had made &#8220;urgent contact&#8221; with xAI over concerns that Grok can create &#8220;undressed images of people and sexualised images of children.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement, the regulator said it would conduct &#8220;a swift assessment to determine whether there are potential compliance issues that warrant investigation&#8221; based on X and xAI&#8217;s response about steps taken to comply with their legal duties to protect UK users. Under the UK&#8217;s Online Safety Act, tech firms are supposed to prevent this type of content being shared and are required to remove it quickly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Two French lawmakers <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-ministers-report-groks-sex-related-content-x-platform-prosecutors-2026-01-02/\">have also filed reports</a> regarding nonconsensual images and the Paris prosecutor confirmed these incidents were added to an existing investigation into X.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/02/india-orders-musks-x-to-fix-grok-over-obscene-ai-content/\">India’s IT ministry has separately ordered</a> X to curb Grok’s obscene and sexually explicit content, particularly involving women and minors, giving the company 72 hours to remove unlawful material, tighten safeguards, and report back or risk loss of safe-harbor protections and further legal action, according to media reports. Malaysia’s communications regulator has reportedly also <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2026/01/04/french-and-malaysian-authorities-are-investigating-grok-for-generating-sexualized-deepfakes/\">launched an investigation</a> into Grok-related deepfakes and warned X it could face enforcement measures if it fails to stop the misuse of AI tools on the platform to generate indecent or offensive images.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>‘The message that sends is quite concerning’</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Henry Ajder, a UK-based deepfakes expert, said that while Musk’s companies may not be directly creating the images, the X platform could still bear responsibility for the proliferation of inappropriate images of minors.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;If you are providing tools or the facilitation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM), there&#8217;s likely going to be legislation which isn&#8217;t tailored to that specific vehicle of harm that will still come into play,” he said. &#8220;In the UK, we&#8217;ve banned both the publication of non-consensual intimate imagery which is AI generated, and we&#8217;re now going after the creation tool sets. I think we&#8217;ll see other countries following suit.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of the reason these images have been created and so widely shared is due to xAI’s recent merger and increasing integration with Musk&#8217;s X social <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/ceqjq11202ro\">media platform</a>. xAI has trained its models using data scraped from X, where Grok now sits as a prominent feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Grok is embedded into a platform which Musk wants to be this super app—your platform for AI, for socials, potentially for payments. If you have this as the anchor point, the operating system for your life, you can&#8217;t escape it,” Ajder said. “If these capabilities are known and not reigned in even after this has been so clearly signposted, the message that sends is quite concerning.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>xAI is not the only company where sexualized AI images have raised concerns. <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/facebook/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta</a> removed dozens of sexualized images of celebrities shared on its platform that were <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/meta-facebook-sexualized-ai-deepfake-celebrity-images-spread/\">created by AI tools last year</a>, and in October OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said the company would loosen restrictions on AI &#8220;erotica&#8221; for adults while stressing that it would restrict harmful content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ajder said xAI has embraced its reputation for pushing the boundaries on acceptable AI content. He said while other mainstream AI models require users to be &#8220;pretty creative, pretty devious&#8221; to generate risky content, Grok has embraced being &#8220;edgier.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From its inception, Grok has been marketed as a “non-woke” alternative to mainstream AI chatbots, especially OpenAI’s ChatGPT. In July last year, xAI launched a &#8220;flirty&#8221; chatbot companion named Ani as part of its Grok chatbot&#8217;s new &#8220;Companions&#8221; feature and was available to users as young as 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>‘Women are being pushed out of the public dialog’</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Women who found explicit images of themselves online generated by Grok say they have been left feeling violated and dehumanized.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Journalist Samantha Smith, who discovered users had created fake bikini images of her on X, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c98p1r4e6m8o\">told the BBC it left her feeling</a> &#8220;dehumanized and reduced into a sexual stereotype.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In <a href=\"https://x.com/SamanthaTaghoy/status/2007114336532373552\">a post on X</a> last week, she wrote: “Any man who is using AI to strip a woman of her clothes would likely also assault a woman if he could get away with it. They do it because it’s not consensual. That’s the whole point. It’s sexual abuse that they can “get away with.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Charlie Smith, a UK based journalist, also found nonconsensual photos of her in a bikini online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I wasn’t sure whether to post this, but someone asked Grok to post a pic of me in a bikiniZ—and Grok replied with a pic,” she wrote in a post on X. “I’ll be honest—it’s upset me. It’s made me feel violated &amp; sad. So, just a reminder that, what may seem like a bit of fun, can be hurtful. Be kind.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>St. Clair told <em>Fortune </em>that she considered X &#8220;the most dangerous company in the world right now&#8221; and accused the company of threatening women&#8217;s ability to exist safely online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s more concerning is that women are being pushed out of the public dialog because of this abuse,&#8221; she said. &#8220;When you are exiling women from the public dialog…because they can&#8217;t operate in it without being abused, you are disproportionately excluding women from AI.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/grok-ai-fake-sexual-images-possible-legal-action-ashley-st-clair/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>President Donald Trump says American Big Oil “want to go in so badly” into Venezuela <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/03/trump-venezuelan-regime-change-nicolas-maduro-oil-us-energy-companies-investment/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/03/trump-venezuelan-regime-change-nicolas-maduro-oil-us-energy-companies-investment/\">and spend billions of dollars</a>, but the reality is U.S. oil producers are hesitant, and it will take many years and many tens of billions of dollars to rebuild Venezuela’s decimated oil sector after the U.S forcibly removed and arrested leader Nicolás Maduro during a string of attacks on Jan. 3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>More than doubling Venezuela’s current oil production likely would take until 2030 and cost about $110 billion, said research firm Rystad Energy, arguing that bringing Venezuela—home to the world’s largest known oil reserves—back to its previous highs would take even longer. Venezuela’s current oil flows of roughly 900,000 barrels daily are about one-third of its volumes at the turn of the century thanks to mismanagement, labor strikes, sanctions, and financial woes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re not waving a magic wand here and, all of a sudden, more oil starts flowing out of Venezuela,” said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer for Pickering Energy Partners consulting and research firm.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You’re not going to bully Exxon [Mobil] and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/chevron/\" target=\"_blank\">Chevron</a> into spending a bunch of money in a risky spot,” Pickering said. “Trump says, ‘Drill, baby, drill,” and the industry didn’t listen to it. They’re not going to blindly deploy capital because the U.S. government says they should.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oil prices remain low—they ticked up less than 2% on Jan. 5—because the world is awash in oil, making it harder to justify costly and risky new foreign investments. “All of the excitement and hype surrounding Venezuela&#8217;s future really deserves a reality check.&nbsp;The hype and reality are very far apart,” said Matt Reed, vice president of the geopolitical and energy consultancy Foreign Reports.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If you&#8217;re talking about building up Venezuela, you&#8217;re talking about bringing in [oil] companies that need real certainty. They need the situation to stabilize. They need to be confident it’s going to stay stable if they&#8217;re going to assume the risk and invest. At this point, no one is going to rush in,” Reed said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Who is going to run Venezuela&nbsp;next year or the year after that?” Reed asked. “The Trump administration says, ‘Well, we&#8217;ll deal with that later.’ In the meantime, the oil companies are not going to assume the best-case scenario is going to unfold and commit to anything.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the U.S. focused in the fall on bombing boats from Venezuela—killing more than 100 people to date—the Trump administration cited narco-terrorism and stemming immigration problems. When the U.S. <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/14/everything-trump-doing-venezuela-south-america-oil-maduro-regime-change/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/14/everything-trump-doing-venezuela-south-america-oil-maduro-regime-change/?utm_source=search&amp;utm_medium=suggested_search&amp;utm_campaign=search_link_clicks\">began seizing oil tankers</a> in December and launched a pseudo-oil blockade, Trump began talking more and more about oil and the 2007 Venezuelan expropriation of oil assets from U.S. companies as justification for the Jan. 3 attacks and arrests. Every U.S. company except Chevron has left Venezuela. Chevron operates under a special license and produces nearly 20% of Venezuela’s oil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The oil companies are going to go in and rebuild their system,” Trump said Jan. 4. “They&#8217;re going to spend billions of dollars, and they&#8217;re going to take the oil out of the ground, and we&#8217;re taking back what they stole. Remember, they stole our property. It was the greatest theft in the history of America.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ironically, Trump is essentially using oil to argue that Venezuela is not like the 2003 Iraq invasion under George W. Bush that critics claimed was about oil, Reed said. “When Trump talks about oil, he’s talking about money. He’s making the argument that any reconstruction is going to pay for itself … and the U.S. can avoid the endless, messy, costly regime change wars that have defined the War on Terror.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A lot of Americans find it distasteful that the U.S. might be waging wars for oil. That’s not a winning argument for politicians,” Reed added.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What comes next?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Wood Mackenzie and other energy research firms believe—within a year—Venezuela could spike its oil volumes from less than 1 million barrels daily to about 1.2 million barrels with U.S. cooperation, and the state-owned oil company PDVSA and Chevron tackling the so-called low-hanging fruit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything else is a lot more complicated to rebuild much of the production, pipeline, and processing infrastructure to get a lot more oil out of the ground and shipped to countries around the world, primarily China and the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, Chevron’s stock jumped 5% on Jan. 5, while <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/exxon-mobil/\" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/conocophillips/\" target=\"_blank\">ConocoPhillips</a> ticked up by more than 2%. Two of the biggest oilfield services players best positioned to work in Venezuela again, Halliburton’s stock rose by almost 8%, and SLB by nearly 9%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The oil companies are reluctant to comment publicly, wanting to avoid upsetting either the Trump administration or the remaining Maduro regime, currently led by Maduro’s vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, who is striking a more conciliatory tone with the U.S. after her initially defiant rhetoric that Maduro was illegally kidnapped and must be released back into power.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exxon, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/halliburton/\" target=\"_blank\">Halliburton</a>, and SLB declined comment for now. ConocoPhillips said it is monitoring the situation and that it is “premature” to speculate on future investments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Chevron said it is focused on the safety of its employees in Venezuela and the integrity of its oil assets, declining any commentary on the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a Washington, D.C. conference in November, Chevron Chairman and CEO Mike Wirth said the geopolitical circumstances are difficult, but Venezuela’s potential is worth the effort. “The kinds of swings that you see in places like Venezuela are challenging. But we play a long game. Venezuela is blessed with a lot of geologic resource and bounty. And&nbsp;we are committed to the people of the country and would like to be there as part of rebuilding Venezuela’s economy in time when circumstances change.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most oil refineries around the world are not configured to process the extra heavy grades of crude that come from Venezuela, but China has many refineries that can and, thus, receives about 80% of Venezuela’s oil exports. Energy analysts said controlling Venezuelan oil could give the U.S. more negotiating leverage with China on the rare earths processing industry dominated by the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of the rest of the oil exports head to the U.S. Gulf Coast, where several refineries thirst for more of the heavy volumes and have increasingly needed to rely instead on heavy Canadian oil sands barrels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, in the short term, Venezuela’s oil output could drop further before it rebounds or is rebuilt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“What matters right now for the oil market is the [naval] blockade. And the blockade is going to stay in place for as long as it takes to get results,” Reed said, arguing that the Venezuelan leadership will need to comply with U.S. demands. “That could be months. That’s a lot of oil the Venezuelans will not be able to export until Trump is satisfied.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/06/trump-ready-send-big-oil-venezuela-reality-messy-many-years/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>President Donald Trump’s plans to restore Venezuela’s beleaguered oil industry faces a series of challenges that will cost U.S. oil companies many billions of dollars to overcome.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the weekend, U.S. forces <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/venezuela-maduro-maria-corina-machado-interview-run-country/\">arrested</a> Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro on drug trafficking charges, with Trump claiming the U.S. would “run” the country and take over the country’s nationalized oil reserves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“American dominance in the western hemisphere will never be questioned again. Won’t happen,” Trump said on Saturday, while explicitly endorsing the &#8220;Donroe doctrine,&#8221; a social media meme/portmanteau that describes the retro-nostalgic version of <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/what-is-the-monroe-doctrine-us-foreign-policy-latin-america-trump-ouster-maduro/\">imperial authority increasingly on display in his second term</a>. The <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/what-is-the-monroe-doctrine-us-foreign-policy-latin-america-trump-ouster-maduro/\">Monroe Doctrine meets the Donald</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The move follows a series of deadly strikes on Venezuelan boats supposedly carrying drugs, attacks widely considered to be illegal. The United Nations Secretary General António Guterres, the body’s top official, called Trump’s ousting of Maduro a violation of the UN’s charter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Home to the world’s largest oil reserves, Venezuela reached its output peak in the 1970s, producing <a href=\"https://hannahritchie.substack.com/p/venezuelan-oil?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=1199196&amp;post_id=183523316&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=1d9he&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email\">more than 3.5 million barrels of oil daily</a>, though production has significantly tapered off to about 1 million barrels daily. Analysts have high hopes that oil companies entering Venezuela can tap back into the country’s black gold. JPMorgan predicted that with control of Venezuela&#8217;s oil, the U.S. could <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/how-much-oil-will-us-have-with-venezuela-30-percent-jpmorgan/?preview_id=4391441\">hold 30% of the world’s oil reserves</a>. Other analysts said the country <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-oil-prices-trump-0c2c6ede79d550af53e6d3ddb51bfa04\">could double or triple its current output</a>, returning it to its highs from 50 years ago, quite quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But experts warn that the path to dominance, at least as far as oil is concerned, will be an uphill battle following decades of mismanagement and sanctions. State-owned oil giant Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA) <a href=\"https://www.iai.it/en/pubblicazioni/c05/venezuelan-oil-industry-collapse-economic-social-and-political-implications\">collapsed in the mid-2010s</a> following the loss of &nbsp;foreign financial support, as well as skilled workers to maintain pipelines. In 2017, the first Trump administration <a href=\"https://www.state.gov/venezuela-related-sanctions\">escalated oil sanctions</a> on Venezuela, restricting the country’s access to U.S. markets.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Small war, big questions</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>According to Helima Croft, head of global commodity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, oil companies’ efforts to grow production, such as rebuilding infrastructure, would take about a decade. She wrote in a note to investors on Saturday that according to oil executives, these efforts will cost $10 billion annually, bringing total investments over the next 10 years to about $100 billion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Part of those steep rebuilding costs are also a result of the need to extract and refine heavy crude oil, which makes up about 75% of Venezuela&#8217;s reserve, most of which is in the Orinoco Belt. Venezuela’s oil boom of yesteryear was also a result of light crude oil found in the oilfields of western Venezuela, which was easy to access and therefore were depleted quickly. While heavy crude oil is what is <a href=\"https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-423-some-topical-material?utm_source=substack&amp;publication_id=192845&amp;post_id=183535301&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_content=share&amp;utm_campaign=email-share&amp;triggerShare=true&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=qrn8&amp;triedRedirect=true\">predominantly being drilled for today</a>, its viscous consistency and high levels of metals and sulfur mean extracting and refining this product is significantly more costly than its light crude counterpart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mass undertaking to restore the Venezuelan oil industry to its peak means oil prices are unlikely to budge anytime soon, said Miguel Tinker Salas, a professor emeritus of history at Paloma College and author of <em>The Enduring Legacy: Oil, Culture, and Society in Venezuela</em>. It’s a hit to Trump’s “<a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/02/09/trump-vows-to-tap-americas-liquid-gold-oil-reserves-and-drill-baby-drill-the-only-problem-is-its-not-up-to-him/\">drill baby, drill</a>” vision and, according to the historian, the president’s hope of gaining momentum ahead of the midterm elections.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The notion that Venezuela has the largest reserves of oil in the world—303 billion barrels of oil [in reserve]—may be a stimulant in trying to get the price of oil to drop for potentially his own electoral purposes,” Tinker Salas told <em>Fortune</em>. “Although [Trump] is grossly mistaken if he thinks that Venezuelan oil comes online tomorrow and will affect prices of oil before the election.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several other analysts see more than a little bit of midterm maneuvering behind the U.S. strike on Venezuela, given the <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/11/08/affordability-politics-off-year-elections-inflation-housing-food-fuel-electricity-costs/\">offyear rout</a> that Republicans suffered in 2025 and <a href=\"https://news.gallup.com/poll/699221/trump-approval-rating-drops-new-second-term-low.aspx#:~:text=WASHINGTON%2C%20D.C.,6%20attack%20on%20the%20Capitol.\">Trump&#8217;s dismal poll ratings</a>. Macquarie’s global analysts <a href=\"https://viktorshvets.com/about-me/\">Viktor Shvets</a> and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/kyle-x-liu/\">Kyle Liu</a> noted that their 2026 outlook included “start a small war” as one policy the Republicans could pursue to avoid a “meltdown” in the midterms. Maduro’s capture is about oil and the Monroe Doctrine, they added, but it also strengthens the Republican Party’s “tough on crime and drugs” image. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elsewhere, UBS chief economist Paul Donovan <a href=\"https://www.ubs.com/content/dam/assets/wm/global/cio/market-insights/paul-donovan-daily-insights/2026/dailyupdate-20260105.mp3?campID=UC:E:601227:601241:269449152:0:179685334:179656654:en:670794390:::\">argued in a Monday podcast</a> that perceptions of “affordability” seem to have shaped U.S. administration policy over the past few weeks. He noted two tariff decisions in particular: a delay on a furniture levy, and a cut on planned fees for tariffs on Italian pasta.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The weekend’s action in Venezuela also raises fiscal questions,” he wrote. “It is not clear how, if at all, the US intends to ‘run’ Venezuela but military adventures carry a fiscal cost. Despite the noise of social media warriors, geopolitical considerations are likely to concern investors less.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Risks of political instability</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The factors influencing U.S. oil companies go beyond just the infrastructure challenges plaguing the industry in Venezuela. According to RBC Capital Markets’ Croft, increasing oil production will hinge on companies feeling confident about the safety of setting up shop in Venezuela. That begins with who will be leading the country moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That individual will likely not be Nobel Peace Prize winner and opposition leader <a href=\"https://fortune.com/videos/watch/venezuela's-fight-for-freedom/aad81684-5471-4f94-b0cf-57d04bbacc63\">María Corina Machado</a>, whom Trump said <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-03/nobel-winner-machado-left-out-of-trump-s-venezuela-plan-for-now\">lacked support</a> to fill the role; nor will it be Edmundo González, who ran against Maduro in the 2024 election, which was <a href=\"https://cartercentee50c07c05.blob.core.windows.net/blobcartercentee50c07c05/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/venezuela-final-report-2025.pdf\">considered to be the fair winner of the election</a>. González is in a self-imposed exile in Spain. Delcy Rodriguez, Maduro’s vice president, was sworn in as Venezuela&#8217;s interim president on Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We don&#8217;t really know who&#8217;s in charge, who is going to be running Venezuela,” Croft <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/video/2026/01/05/who-will-lead-venezuelas-turnaround-effort-is-key-question-rbc-capitals-croft.html\">told CNBC</a> on Monday.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. will also have to learn from its past efforts to build up authority <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/venezuela-regime-change-iraq-afghanistan-libya-lessons-american-statecraft/\">in the oil-rich countries of Iraq and Libya</a>. Both endeavors included attempts to depose the countries’ respective leaders that led to political collapse and civil unrest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We thought Libya was going to be an easy turnaround, post-[former Libyan Prime Minister Muammar] Gaddafi,” Croft said. “So the question is, What&#8217;s our template for a rapid recovery of an oil sector that has suffered decades of decline and mismanagement?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tinker Salas argued that other factors, including an improvement in technology to extract low crude oil, could expedite production, but until there’s evidence that companies can thrive in Venezuela, there will likely be few efforts to escalate drilling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I don&#8217;t think any large U.S. major company is going to want to invest without a series of guarantees, because you&#8217;re talking about billions of dollars of investment,” Tinker Salas said. “This is an investment for the long term, not for the short term.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Macquarie’s Shvets and Liu added an ominous warning for the long term of U.S. foreign policy, writing, that this is “another nail in the coffin of [the] global rules-based order,” marginalizing the UN “similar to the League of Nations circa 1930s.” The League of Nations was the forerunner to the UN and is famous among historians for its formation after the wreckage of World War I and its almost immediate failure to prevent the rise of authoritarianism in the 1930s that gave way to World War II.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This could also signal that the Church Committee rules may be “obsolete,” the Macquarie analysts wrote, referring to the regulations in place since 1975 to address abuses intelligence revealed during the Vietnam era. The CIA reportedly played a critical role in ensuring the success of this military action in Venezuela, after all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A strong Republican midterm showing would reinforce the “unitary system of governance,” on the one hand, but Macquarie argued that it would likely further erode the “few remaining semi-independent agencies (principally the Fed).” Right on cue, a new Federal Reserve chairman is <a href=\"https://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/trump-narrows-fed-chair-picks-january-decision-expected\">expected to be selected in the coming days</a>.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/how-much-oil-is-in-venezuela-trump-maduro-jpmorgan-outlook/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

Yet Trump has offered few specifics on how production would be restored or who would control revenues in the interim.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked if he had spoken to top executives at <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/exxon-mobil/\" target=\"_blank\">Exxon Mobil</a> Corp., <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/chevron/\" target=\"_blank\">Chevron</a> Corp. and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/conocophillips/\" target=\"_blank\">ConocoPhillips</a>, Trump said it was “too soon” to reveal whether he had any conversations, adding: “I speak to everybody.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>US Energy Secretary Chris Wright plans to talk this week with oil-industry executives, according to people familiar with the matter. Wright will attend the Goldman Sachs Energy, Clean Tech &amp; Utilities Conference in Miami this week that executives from Chevron, ConocoPhillips and other companies are scheduled to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-05/us-to-meet-with-oil-executives-this-week-on-venezuela-revival\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trump’s Energy Boss to Meet with Oil Companies on Venezuela</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Years of corruption, underinvestment, fires and thefts have left Venezuela’s crude facilities in tatters.

Chevron is the only oil supermajor still operating in Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump did not detail how much he thought an effort to rebuild and expand Venezuela’s oil infrastructure could cost, according to NBC News, saying only that “It’ll be a very substantial amount of money will be spent.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US president also said he foresaw expanded energy flows from Venezuela helping to “reduce oil prices.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Having a Venezuela that’s an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down,” Trump said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The president has sought to convince voters ahead of this year’s crucial midterm elections that his administration is working to address pocketbook issues, although concerns about affordability have largely centered around costs for groceries and housing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-05/trump-s-venezuela-oil-revival-plan-is-a-100-billion-gamble\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trump’s Venezuela Oil Revival Plan Is a $100 Billion Gamble</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump’s remarks come as he faces skepticism over his audacious military intervention in Venezuela, which resulted in the capture of Maduro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US president has said the raid was necessary to apprehend a man American authorities have accused of running a drug-trafficking operation and to retake oil assets. Opponents said the US may have broken international law, while warning Trump doesn’t have congressional or public approval for the US taking on a nation-building project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A defiant Maduro was arraigned in New York on Monday and pleaded not guilty to drug and weapons charges, saying he was an “innocent” and “decent man.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Read more:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2026-01-05/trump-s-ouster-of-venezuela-s-maduro-puts-spotlight-on-cuba-greenland\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Trump’s Ousting of Maduro Shows His New World Order Is Here&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The US president on Monday said Delcy Rodriguez, who served as Maduro’s vice president and was sworn in as acting president following his removal, had been cooperating with his administration, and downplayed the prospect of quick elections in the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We have to fix the country first.

Recent, massive oil finds off the coast of Guyana are largely controlled by <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/exxon-mobil/\" target=\"_blank\">ExxonMobil</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/chevron/\" target=\"_blank\">Chevron</a>. U.S. control of the Venezuelan energy industry, which sits on the world’s largest oil reserves, could “reshape the balance of power in international energy markets,” analysts with JP Morgan wrote Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The combined total could position the US as a leading holder of global oil reserves, potentially accounting for about 30% of the world’s total if these figures are consolidated under US influence,” JP Morgan wrote. “This would mark a notable shift in global energy dynamics.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuela’s oil industry is in disrepair after years of neglect and international sanctions.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-oil-prices-trump-0c2c6ede79d550af53e6d3ddb51bfa04\">Yet some oil industry analysts</a>&nbsp;believe that Venezuela could double or triple its current output of about 1.1 million barrels of oil a day and return the nation to historic production levels relatively quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“With greater access to and influence over a substantial portion of global reserves, the US could potentially exert more control over oil market trends, helping to stabilize prices and keep them within historically lower ranges,” according to JP Morgan. &#8220;This increased leverage would not only enhance US energy security but could also reshape the balance of power in international energy markets.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If or when that would happen, however, is more complex. Many energy analysts see a longer and more difficult road ahead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“While the Trump administration has suggested large U.S. oil companies will go into Venezuela and spend billions to fix infrastructure, we believe political and other risks along with current relatively low oil prices could prevent this from happening anytime soon,” wrote Neal Dingmann of William Blair. Material change to Venezuelan production will take a lot of time and millions of dollars of infrastructure improvement, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And any investment in Venezuelan infrastructure right now would take place in a weakened global energy market. Crude prices in the U.S. are down 20% compared with last year. The price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude hasn’t been above $70 since June, and hasn’t touched $80 per barrel since the summer of 2024.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A barrel of oil cost more than $130 in the leadup to the the U.S. housing crisis in 2008.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s several factors that could impact Venezuelan production, including how quickly a government transition can take hold and how fast and willing multinational oil companies are to reenter the country, wrote John Freeman of Raymond James.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the opening bell, shares in the energy sector moved broadly higher, particularly companies with large refinery operations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuela produces the kind of heavy crude oil that’s needed for diesel fuel, asphalt and other fuels for heavy equipment. Diesel is in short supply around the world because of the sanctions on oil from Venezuela and Russia and because America’s lighter crude oil can’t easily replace it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Big refiners like Valero, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/marathon-petroleum/\" target=\"_blank\">Marathon Petroleum</a> and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/conocophillips/\" target=\"_blank\">Phillips 66</a> rose between 5% and 6% at the opening bell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oilfield service companies, those that actually go into the field and do the drilling and upkeep, rose even more sharply. SLB and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/halliburton/\" target=\"_blank\">Halliburton</a> rose between 7% and 8%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Major oil exploratory companies including ExxonMobil, Chevron and ConocoPhillips rose between 2% and 4%.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/how-much-oil-will-us-have-with-venezuela-30-percent-jpmorgan/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

Numerous European leaders expressed solidarity with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If the United States chooses to attack another NATO country militarily, then everything stops,” Frederiksen told Danish broadcaster TV2 on Monday. “That is, including our NATO and thus the security that has been provided since the end of the Second World War.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">20-day timeline deepens fears</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump called repeatedly during his presidential transition and the early months of his second term for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has not ruled out military force to take control of the island. His comments Sunday, including telling reporters “let’s talk about Greenland in 20 days,” further deepened fears that the U.S. was planning an intervention in Greenland in the near future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frederiksen also said Trump “should be taken seriously” when he says he wants Greenland. “We will not accept a situation where we and Greenland are threatened in this way,” she added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nielsen, in a news conference Monday, said Greenland cannot be compared to Venezuela. He urged his constituents to stay calm and united.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are not in a situation where we think that there might be a takeover of the country overnight and that is why we are insisting that we want good cooperation,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nielsen added: “The situation is not such that the United States can simply conquer Greenland.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ask Rostrup, a TV2 political journalist, wrote on the station&#8217;s live blog Monday that Mette previously would have flatly rejected the idea of an American takeover of Greenland. But now, Rostrup wrote, the rhetoric has escalated so much that she has to acknowledge the possibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump slams Denmark&#8217;s security efforts in Greenland</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump on Sunday also mocked Denmark’s efforts at boosting Greenland’s national security posture, saying the Danes have added “one more dog sled” to the Arctic territory’s arsenal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s so strategic right now,” Trump had told reporters Sunday as he flew back to Washington from his home in Florida. “Greenland is covered with Russian and Chinese ships all over the place.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security, and Denmark is not going to be able to do it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Ulrik Pram Gad, a global security expert from the Danish Institute for International Studies, wrote in a report last year that “there are indeed Russian and Chinese ships in the Arctic, but these vessels are too far away to see from Greenland with or without binoculars.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">U.S. space base in northwestern Greenland</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled this weekend by a social media post following the raid by a former Trump administration official turned podcaster, Katie Miller. The post shows an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: “SOON.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Ambassador Jesper Møller Sørensen, Denmark’s chief envoy to Washington, said in a post responding to Miller, who is married to Trump’s influential deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. Department of Defense operates the remote Pituffik Space Base in northwestern Greenland. It was built following a 1951 defense agreement between Denmark and the United States. It supports missile warning, missile defense and space surveillance operations for the U.S. and NATO.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Denmark’s mainland, the partnership between the U.S. and Denmark has been long-lasting. The Danes buy American F-35 fighter jets and just last year, Denmark’s parliament approved a bill to allow U.S. military bases on Danish soil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics say the vote ceded Danish sovereignty to the U.S. The legislation widens a previous military agreement, made in 2023 with the Biden administration, where U.S. troops had broad access to Danish air bases in the Scandinavian country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>___</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ciobanu reported from Warsaw, Poland, and Dazio from Berlin.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/denmark-threatens-to-end-postwar-peace-under-nato-if-trump-seizes-greenland/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>A defiant&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-trump-military-operation-85041a1ec03bafe839b785a95169d694\">Nicolás Maduro</a>&nbsp;declared himself &#8220;the president of my country” as he protested his capture and pleaded not guilty Monday to federal drug trafficking charges that the Trump administration used to justify removing him from power in Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I was captured,” Maduro said in Spanish as translated by a courtroom reporter before being cut off by the judge. Asked later for his plea to the charges, he stated: &#8220;I’m innocent. I am not guilty. I am a decent man, the president of my country.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The courtroom appearance, Maduro&#8217;s first since he and his wife were&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-maduro-venezuela-presidential-palace-blowtorches-7969152ae48510003fe9cbde92f3c102\">seized from their home</a>&nbsp;in a stunning middle-of-the-night military operation, kicked off the U.S. government’s most consequential prosecution in decades of a foreign head of state. The criminal case in Manhattan is unfolding against a broader diplomatic backdrop of an audacious U.S.-engineered regime change that President Donald Trump has said will enable his administration&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-trump-military-operation-85041a1ec03bafe839b785a95169d694\">to “run” the South American country.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maduro was led into court along with his co-defendant wife just before noon for the brief legal proceeding. Both put on headsets to hear the English-language proceeding as it was translated into Spanish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The couple was transported to the Manhattan courthouse under armed guard early Monday from the Brooklyn jail where they&#8217;ve been detained since arriving in the U.S. on Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A legal fight begins</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>As a criminal defendant in the U.S. legal system, Maduro will have the same rights as any other person accused of a crime — including the right to a trial by a jury of regular New Yorkers. But he’ll also be nearly — but not quite — unique.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The stakes were made clear from the outset as Maduro, who took copious notes throughout the proceedings and wished a Happy New Year to reporters in court, repeatedly pressed his case that he had been unlawfully abducted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I am here kidnapped,&#8221; Maduro said. “I was captured at my home in Caracas.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein, a 92-year-old jurist who was appointed to the federal bench in 1998 by Bill Clinton, interrupted him, saying: “There will be time and place to go through all of this.&#8221; Hellerstein added that Maduro’s attorney could do so later.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At this time, I just want to know if you are Nicolás Maduro Moros,” which Maduro confirmed that he was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maduro’s lawyers are expected to contest the legality of his arrest, arguing that he is immune from prosecution as head of state. Barry Pollack, a prominent Washington lawyer whose clients have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/julian-assange\">included WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange</a>, said Maduro is &#8220;head of a sovereign state and entitled to the privilege” that the status ensures. He also said the defense would raise “questions about the legality of his military abduction.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Panamanian strongman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/3fe8263a03504924b32f09b7fb0db0e6\">Manuel Noriega</a>&nbsp;unsuccessfully&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maduro-noriega-prosecution-legal-immunity-venezuela-panama-c0df9b1ecda36e9e1912729fa7ebf9e4\">tried the same immunity defense</a>&nbsp;after the U.S. captured him in a similar military invasion in 1990. But the U.S. doesn’t recognize Maduro as Venezuela’s legitimate head of state — particularly after a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-presidential-election-maduro-machado-edmundo-5ce255ae90614162590bfe1207d2e1d0\">much-disputed 2024 reelection</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maduro&#8217;s wife, Cilia Flores, also pleaded not guilty on Monday. She had bandages on her forehead and right temple, and her lawyer said had she suffered “significant injuries” during her capture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/interactive/us-indicts-venezuela-maduro/\">A 25-page indictment</a>&nbsp;accuses Maduro and others of working with drug cartels to facilitate the shipment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maduro-indictment-justice-department-trump-bondi-25a6fbd922472296c744eb5111cd914c\">thousands of tons of cocaine</a>&nbsp;into the U.S. They could face life in prison if convicted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among other things, the indictment accuses Maduro and his wife of ordering kidnappings, beatings and murders of those who owed them drug money or undermined their drug trafficking operation. That included a local drug boss’ killing in Caracas, the indictment said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Outside the courthouse, police separated protesters of the U.S. military action from pro-intervention demonstrators. Inside the courtroom, as Maduro stood to leave with federal officers, a man in the audience stood and began speaking forcefully at him in Spanish, calling him an “illegitimate” president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The man, 33-year-old Pedro Rojas, said later that he had been imprisoned by the Venezuelan regime. As deputy U.S. marshals led Maduro from the courtroom, the deposed leader looked directly at the man and shot back in Spanish: “I am a kidnapped president. I am a prisoner of war.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Demands for Maduro&#8217;s return</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The U.S. seized Maduro and his wife in a military operation early Saturday, capturing them in their home on a military base. Trump said Saturday the U.S. would “run” Venezuela temporarily and reiterated Sunday night that “we&#8217;re in charge,” telling reporters aboard Air Force One that “we&#8217;re going to run it, fix it.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secretary of State Marco Rubio had tried to strike a more cautious tone on Sunday morning talk shows, saying the U.S. would not govern the country day-to-day other than enforcing an existing ”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-venezuela-maduro-oil-tankers-625a7c9a3106e316c97ceb68a42a1cb5\">oil quarantine</a>.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before his capture, Maduro and his allies claimed U.S. hostility was motivated by lust for Venezuela’s rich oil and mineral resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has suggested that removing Maduro would enable more oil to flow out of Venezuela, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-oil-venezuela-trump-gas-67c87db7e47d15e3bf01df7fe4d560b2\">oil prices</a>&nbsp;rose a bit more than 1% in Monday morning trading to roughly $58 a barrel. There are uncertainties about how fast oil production can be ramped up in Venezuela after years of neglect, as well as questions about governance and oversight of the sector.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuela’s new interim leader,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-interim-president-rodriguez-maduro-chavez-b352b5af17deb0ab78684b8398045179\">Delcy Rodríguez</a>, has demanded that the U.S. return Maduro, who long denied any involvement in drug trafficking — although late Sunday she also struck a more conciliatory tone in a social media post, inviting collaboration with Trump and “respectful relations” with the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodríguez was sworn in on Monday by her brother, National Assembly leader Jorge Rodríguez.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I come with sorrow for the suffering inflicted upon the Venezuelan people following an illegitimate military aggression against our homeland,” she said with her right hand up. “I come with sorrow for the kidnapping of two heroes.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maduro’s son and Venezuelan congressman Nicolás Maduro Guerra warned on Monday that his father&#8217;s capture could set a dangerous precedent globally and demanded that his parents be returned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“If we normalize the kidnapping of a head of state, no country is safe. Today it’s Venezuela. Tomorrow it could be any nation that refuses to submit. This is not a regional problem. It is a direct threat to global political stability,” Maduro Guerra said</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also Monday, the United Nations Security Council&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-united-nations-maduro-trump-waltz-1433e10bbb800fb41b21a70c7501ad88\">held an emergency meeting</a>, with the top U.N. official warning that America may have violated international law with its unilateral action. The world body also spotlighted the profound humanitarian needs in Venezuela. Its people have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-black-friday-maduro-trump-drug-strikes-dcca2242e7326865419d45eb48a0ca1b\">endured a yearslong, complex economic crisis</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>___</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tucker reported from Washington.

      "content": "\n<p>The U.S. took the unprecedented step Monday of dropping the number of vaccines it recommends for every child — cutting protection against a half-dozen diseases in a move slammed by the nation&#8217;s pediatricians.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The overhaul is effective immediately, meaning that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will now recommend vaccines against 11 diseases. What&#8217;s no longer broadly recommended is protection against&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/us-flu-cases-cdc-subclade-k-29cc5a68eb100585c8e0dbd2ec47b3eb\">flu</a>, rotavirus, hepatitis A, hepatitis B, some forms of meningitis or RSV. Instead, protections against those diseases are only recommended for certain groups deemed high-risk, or if their doctors recommend them in what&#8217;s called “shared decision-making.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump administration officials said the overhaul, a move long sought by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., won&#8217;t result in families who want the vaccines losing access to them, and said insurance will continue to pay. But medical experts said the move increases confusion for parents and could increase preventable diseases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The change came after President Donald Trump in December&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/12/aligning-united-states-core-childhood-vaccine-recommendations-with-best-practices-from-peer-developed-countries/\">asked the U.S. Department of Health</a>&nbsp;and Human Services to review how peer nations approach vaccine recommendations and consider revising its guidance to align with theirs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>HHS said its comparison to 20 peer nations found that the U.S. was an “outlier” in both the number of vaccinations and the number of doses it recommended to all children. Officials with the agency framed the change as a way to increase public trust by recommending only the most important vaccinations for children to receive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those left on the recommended-for-everyone list are measles, whooping cough, polio, tetanus, chickenpox and HPV.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This decision protects children, respects families, and rebuilds trust in public health,” Kennedy said in a statement Monday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Medical experts disagreed, saying the change without public discussion or a transparent review of the data would put children at risk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dr. Sean O’Leary of the American Academy of Pediatrics said countries carefully consider vaccine recommendations based on levels of disease in their populations and their health systems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“You can’t just copy and paste public health and that’s what they seem to be doing here,” said O’Leary. “Literally children&#8217;s health and children&#8217;s lives are at stake.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new guidance also reduces the number of recommended vaccine doses against human papillomavirus from two or three shots to one for most children, depending on age.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The decision was made without input from an advisory committee that typically consults on the vaccine schedule, said senior officials at HHS. The officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the changes publicly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Abandoning recommendations for vaccines that prevent influenza, hepatitis and rotavirus, and changing the recommendation for HPV without a public process to weigh the risks and benefits, will lead to more hospitalizations and preventable deaths among American children,” said Michael Osterholm of the Vaccine Integrity Project, based at the University of Minnesota.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/americas-pediatricians-reel-as-government-slashes-vaccine-requirements-for-children/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "title": "After Nvidia’s Groq deal, meet the other AI chip startups that may be in play—and one looking to disrupt them all",
      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-groq-deal-ai-chip-startups-in-play/",
      "content": "\n<p><a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a> dropped a <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2025/12/30/nvidias-groq-bet-shows-that-the-economics-of-ai-chip-building-are-still-unsettled/\">surprise announcement</a> on Christmas Eve: a $20 billion deal to license AI chip startup Groq’s technology and bring over most of its team, including cofounder and CEO Jonathan Ross. It was a move that hinted Nvidia is no longer assuming its GPUs will be the only chips useful for the next big phase of AI deployment: running already trained AI models to do everything from answering queries and generating code to analyzing an image—a process known as inference—and doing so at a huge scale.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Groq deal bolsters the standing of other startups building their own AI chips, including Cerebras, D-Matrix, and SambaNova—which <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/intel/\" target=\"_blank\">Intel</a> has reportedly signed a term sheet to acquire—as well as newer players like U.K.-based chip startup Fractile. It also lifts AI inference software platform startups like Etched, Fireworks, and Baseten, strengthening their valuations and making them more attractive acquisition targets in 2026, according to analysts, founders, and investors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Karl Freund, founder and principal analyst at Cambrian-AI Research, pointed to the Microsoft-backed D-Matrix, which raised $275 million last month at a $2 billion valuation. Like Groq, D-Matrix is focused on trading some of the flexibility of Nvidia’s GPUs for greater speed and efficiency when running AI models. “I’m sure D-Matrix is a pretty happy startup right now,” Freund said. “I suspect their next round will be at a much higher valuation.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cerebras, another inference-focused chip company, also appears well positioned. Known for its dinner-plate-size &#8220;wafer-scale&#8221; chip designed to run extremely large models on a single piece of silicon, Cerebras has filed for an IPO after a previous delay. Freund said the company has increasingly been viewed as a potential acquisition target as well. “You don’t want to wait until after the IPO, when it’s more expensive,” he said. “From that perspective, Cerebras is sitting pretty right now.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Nvidia-Groq deal has clarified market’s direction</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Executives at these companies say Nvidia’s move has helped clarify the market’s direction. “When [the Nvidia-Groq deal] happened, we said, ‘Finally, the market recognizes it,’” Sid Sheth, CEO of D-Matrix, told <em>Fortune</em>. “I think what Nvidia has really done is they said, Okay, this approach is a winning approach.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Cerebras CEO Andrew Feldman <a href=\"https://x.com/andrewdfeldman\">posted on X</a> that, in the past, the perception that Nvidia GPUs were all you needed for AI acted as a moat, keeping AI chip startups from nibbling away at Nvidia&#8217;s market share. But that moat is now gone with the Groq deal, Feldman wrote. “It reflects a growing industry reality—the inference market is fragmenting, and a new category has emerged where speed isn&#8217;t a feature—it&#8217;s the entire value proposition. A value prop that can only be achieved by a different chip architecture than the GPU.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, not everyone is convinced that every inference chip startup will benefit equally. Matt Murphy, a partner at Menlo Ventures, said the chip sector remains a difficult one for venture investors, given the high capital requirements and long timelines. “A lot of VCs stopped investing in chips 10 or 15 years ago,” Murphy said. “It’s capital-intensive; it takes years to get a product out; and the outcomes are hard to predict.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That said, he pointed to Fireworks, an AI inference platform that raised $250 million at a $4 billion valuation in October, as a startup with a technical advantage, thanks to a founding team filled with engineers who built PyTorch. But he added that it remains unclear how much of the current enthusiasm reflects genuine technical differentiation. “It&#8217;s hard to tell who&#8217;s really got something significant versus the tide is [raising] all boats, which is what seems to be going on,” he said, adding that consolidation across the sector now appears increasingly likely.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">New entrant seeks true disruption</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But at least one veteran of the AI hardware world argues that even today’s inference-focused startups are not truly disruptive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Naveen Rao, former SVP of AI at Databricks and founder of MosaicML, recently left Databricks to start Unconventional AI, which last month confirmed a massive $475 million seed round&nbsp;led by Andreessen Horowitz and Lightspeed Ventures. His critique: Companies like Groq, D-Matrix, and Cerebras may be well positioned in today’s market, but they are still optimizing within the same digital computing paradigm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After Nvidia’s Groq deal validated demand for faster, more efficient inference, startups that fit neatly into today’s AI stack suddenly look far more valuable—not because they reinvented computing, Rao argues, but because they work within it. Unconventional AI is pursuing a more radical path: building new hardware that exploits the physical behavior of silicon itself, and redesigning neural networks to match it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We&#8217;ve been building the same fundamental machine for 80 years, a numeric digital machine,” he said. “But there was never one workload that dominated even more than 2% of all compute cycles.” That is changing, he explained: In a few years, 95% of all compute will be used for AI.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From that standpoint, it’s important to construct an entirely different machine than what is built today, he said. However, Rao says the effort could take five years or more to bear fruit—and is not intended to capitalize on the current inference boom.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/05/nvidia-groq-deal-ai-chip-startups-in-play/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>Stock futures and oil prices edged higher on Sunday evening as investors began to digest the implications of the U.S. military raid on Venezuela that captured Nicolas Maduro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the country has the world&#8217;s largest proven oil reserves, production has been waning for years amid U.S. sanctions, mismanagement by the Maduro regime, and underinvestment. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>President Donald Trump said Saturday that Maduro&#8217;s removal will unleash a surge of investment in Venezuela&#8217;s oil industry and revive output, though analysts have said that could take years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, Venezuela&#8217;s shrinking influence in the world&#8217;s oil landscape has Wall Street downplaying much near-term effects from U.S. intervention there. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The physical global oil market situation remains the same. Oil prices have declined due to an oversupplied global oil market,&#8221; said Rob Hummel, senior portfolio manager at Tortoise Capital Management, said in a note. &#8220;The current events in Venezuela don&#8217;t change this dynamic.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. oil futures rose 0.19% to $57.43 a barrel, and Brent crude climbed 0.28% to $60.92 a barrel, with both benchmarks reversing earlier losses. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>OPEC+ also backed plans to <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/opec-plus-production-q1-crude-prices-venezuela-maduro/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/opec-plus-production-q1-crude-prices-venezuela-maduro/\">keep production steady</a> through the first quarter and hold off on any further hikes, as oil markets still face a supply glut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Futures tied to the Dow Jones industrial average were essentially flat, down 5 points. S&amp;P 500 futures were up 0.10%, and Nasdaq futures added 0.32%. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The yield on the 10-year Treasury was unchanged at 4.191%. The U.S. dollar was up 0.14% against the euro and up 0.22% against the yen. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gold rallied 1.7% to $4,403.70 per ounce, and silver jumped 5.4% to $74.86. Bitcoin edged up 2.3% to $92,265.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the successful Venezuela raid, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/venezuela-raid-greenland-minerals-arctic-china-russia-denmark-nato/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/venezuela-raid-greenland-minerals-arctic-china-russia-denmark-nato/\">Trump said he is still eyeing Greenland</a> and warned Cuba is &#8220;very similar&#8221; to the Maduro regime. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the economic calendar may bring his focus back on the U.S. economy rather than more foreign adventures. The upcoming batch of numbers is also highly anticipated as they will largely be free from distortions related to the government shutdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Monday, the Institute for Supply Management will release its manufacturing activity index. On Wednesday, ADP puts out its private-sector payroll report, and the Labor Department publishes job opening and turnover report. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And on Friday, the Labor Department will issue its monthly jobs report, with Wall Street expecting a gain of just 54,000 and another increase in the unemployment rate to 4.7%.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/crude-oil-prices-venezuela-maduro-ouster-stock-market-today-dow-futures-jobs-report/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

I really don’t know.” The White House did not respond to a request for comment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump, in his administration&#8217;s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-security-strategy-europe-russia-america-first-068488ca7e6d1c92ccaddd1649958218\">National Security Strategy</a>&nbsp;published last month, laid out restoring “American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” as a central guidepost for his second go-around in the White House.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has also pointed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/monroe-doctrine-venezuela-trump-western-hemisphere-maduro-e5581d71ea15f2fb02461e74ac6b08ca\">the 19th century Monroe Doctrine</a>, which rejects European colonialism, as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/roosevelt-corollary\">Roosevelt Corollary</a>&nbsp;— a justification invoked by the U.S. in supporting Panama’s secession from Colombia, which helped secure the Panama Canal Zone for the U.S. — as he&#8217;s made his case for an assertive approach to American neighbors and beyond.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump has even quipped that some now refer to the fifth U.S. president&#8217;s foundational document as the “Don-roe Doctrine.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Saturday&#8217;s dead-of-night operation by U.S. forces in Caracas and Trump’s Atlantic interview heightened concerns in Denmark, which has jurisdiction over the vast mineral-rich island of Greenland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/greenland-denmark-prime-minister-frederiksen-visit-trump-4424e2b75ae66ad1c926dca50f2287b7\">Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen</a>&nbsp;in a statement following Trump&#8217;s latest comments on Greenland said he has &#8220;no right to annex&#8221; the territory. She also reminded Trump that Denmark already provides the United States, a fellow member of NATO, broad access to Greenland through existing security agreements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I would therefore strongly urge the U.S. to stop threatening a historically close ally and another country and people who have made it very clear that they are not for sale,” Frederiksen said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Denmark on Sunday also signed onto a European Union statement underscoring that “the right of the Venezuelan people to determine their future must be respected” as Trump has vowed to “run” Venezuela and pressed the acting president,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-trump-maduro-military-rodriguez-lead-c0bd39f98a79c18c5501bac939c640fe\">Delcy Rodriguez, to get in line.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Greenlanders and Danes were further rankled by a social media post following the raid by a former Trump administration official turned podcaster, Katie Miller. The post shows an illustrated map of Greenland in the colors of the Stars and Stripes accompanied by the caption: “SOON.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And yes, we expect full respect for the territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Denmark,” Amb. Jesper Møller Sørensen, Denmark&#8217;s chief envoy to Washington, said in a post responding to Miller, who is married to Trump&#8217;s influential deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-greenland-norway-panama-canal-canada-a52858e3075f9b5ad95e78753293fc1f\">his presidential transition</a>&nbsp;and in the early months of his return to the White House, Trump repeatedly called for U.S. jurisdiction over Greenland, and has pointedly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/greenland-denmark-vance-visit-us-base-834785773189f2f12ec6b09f8c5a9321\">not ruled out military force</a>&nbsp;to take control of the mineral-rich, strategically located Arctic island that belongs to an ally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The issue had largely drifted out of the headlines in recent months. Then Trump put the spotlight back on Greenland less than two weeks ago when he said he would appoint Republican&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-greenland-jeff-landry-envoy-louisiana-6babac895313a5ec65b5df79c7f86b45\">Gov. Jeff Landry</a>&nbsp;as his special envoy to Greenland.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Louisiana governor said in his volunteer position he would help Trump “make Greenland a part of the U.S.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">A stern warning to Cuba</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, concern simmered in Cuba, one of Venezuela’s most important allies and trading partners, as Rubio issued a new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/video/trump-says-cuba-not-doing-very-well-and-rubio-hints-it-could-be-next-after-maduro-out-of-venezuela-9fc1a1ec0e164726953e48a1f35cb221\">stern warning</a>&nbsp;to the Cuban government. U.S.-Cuba relations have been hostile since the 1959 Cuban revolution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio, in an appearance on NBC&#8217;s “Meet the Press,” said Cuban officials were with Maduro in Venezuela ahead of his capture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It was Cubans that guarded Maduro,” Rubio said. “He was not guarded by Venezuelan bodyguards. He had Cuban bodyguards.” The secretary of state added that Cuban bodyguards were also in charge of “internal intelligence” in Maduro’s government, including “who spies on who inside to make sure there are no traitors.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump on Saturday told reporters that he viewed the Cuban government as “very similar” to Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I think Cuba is going to be something we’ll end up talking about, because Cuba is a failing nation right now, a very badly failing nation, and we want to help the people,&#8221; Trump said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuban authorities called a rally in support of Venezuela’s government and railed against the U.S. military operation, writing in a statement: “All the nations of the region must remain alert, because the threat hangs over all of us.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio, a former Florida senator and son of Cuban immigrants, has long maintained Cuba is a dictatorship repressing its people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live — and we’re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operation for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States,&#8221; Rubio said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cubans like 55-year-old biochemical laboratory worker Bárbara Rodríguez were following developments in Venezuela. She said she worried about what she described as an “aggression against a sovereign state.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It can happen in any country, it can happen right here. We have always been in the crosshairs,” Rodríguez said.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/venezuela-raid-greenland-minerals-arctic-china-russia-denmark-nato/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "link": "https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/is-ai-boom-bubble-pop-tech-stocks-sp500-bull-run/",
      "content": "\n<p>As the artificial intelligence trade continues to push the stock market to new highs, investors are increasingly asking if we’re living through another financial bubble that’s destined to burst.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The answer isn’t so simple, at least according to history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500 Index jumped 16% in 2025, with AI winners <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/nvidia/\" target=\"_blank\">Nvidia</a> Corp., <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/alphabet/\" target=\"_blank\">Alphabet</a> Inc., <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/broadcom/\" target=\"_blank\">Broadcom</a> Inc. and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/microsoft/\" target=\"_blank\">Microsoft</a> Corp. contributing the most. But at the same time, concerns are mounting about the hundreds of billions of dollars Big Tech has pledged to spend on AI infrastructure. Capital expenditures from Microsoft, Alphabet, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/amazon-com/\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>.com Inc. and <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/facebook/\" target=\"_blank\">Meta Platforms</a> Inc. are expected to rise 34% to roughly $440 billion combined over the next year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, OpenAI has committed to spending more than $1 trillion on AI infrastructure, an eye-popping number for a closely held company that isn’t profitable. But perhaps even more troubling is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-23/nvidia-s-massive-openai-deal-fuels-circular-financing-concerns\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">circular nature</a>&nbsp;of many of its arrangements, in which investments and spending go back and forth between OpenAI and a few publicly traded tech giants.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout history, over-investment has been a common theme when there’s a technological advancement that will transform society, according to Invesco chief global market strategist Brian Levitt, who pointed to the development of railroads, electricity and the internet. This time may be no different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“At some point the infrastructure build may exceed what the economy will need over a short period of time,” he said. “But that doesn’t mean that the rail tracks weren’t finished or the internet didn’t become a thing, right?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, with equity valuations creeping up and the S&amp;P 500 just posting its third straight year of double-digit percentage gains, it makes sense that investors are growing concerned about how much upside is left and how much market value could be lost if AI doesn’t live up to the hype. Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon.com, Broadcom and Meta Platforms account for almost 30% of the S&amp;P 500, so an AI selloff would hit the index hard. &nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“A bubble likely crashes on a bear market,” said Gene Goldman, chief investment officer at Cetera Financial Group, who doesn’t believe AI stocks are in a bubble. “We just don’t see a bear market anytime soon.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here’s how today’s AI boom stacks up against previous market bubbles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Pace, Length</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One simple way of gaging whether the AI-fueled tech rally has gone too far or too fast is to compare it against past bull runs. Looking at 10 equity bubbles from around the world since 1900, they lasted just over two-and-a-half years on average with a trough-to-peak gain of 244%, according to research by <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/bank-of-america-corp/\" target=\"_blank\">Bank of America</a> strategist Michael Hartnett.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By comparison, the AI-driven rally is in its third year, with the S&amp;P 500 rising 79% since the end of 2022 and the tech-heavy <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/nasdaq/\" target=\"_blank\">Nasdaq</a> 100 Index gaining 130%.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While it’s difficult to draw any conclusions from the data, Hartnett warns investors against fleeing the stock market even if they believe it’s in a bubble because the last stretch of the rally is typically the steepest, and missing out would be costly. One way to hedge is to buy cheap value plays like UK stocks and energy companies, he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Concentration</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500’s 10 biggest stocks now account for roughly 40% of the index, a level of concentration not seen since the 1960s. That has put some investors off, including Wall Street research veteran Ed Yardeni, who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-08/yardeni-says-underweight-mag-7-in-shift-from-tech-after-15-years-miwgrfr2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a>&nbsp;in December that it no longer makes sense to recommend overweighting tech stocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Market historians argue that, while the concentration seems extreme relative to recent memory, there are precedents. Top stocks as a share of the US market were at similar levels in the 1930s and 1960s, according to London Business School professor Paul Marsh, who studied the past 125 years of global asset returns. In 1900, 63% of US market value was tied to railroad stocks, compared with 37% tied to technology at the end of 2024, Marsh said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fundamentals</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Asset bubbles tend to be much harder to spot in real time than after the fact because fundamentals are usually at the center of the debate, and the metrics investors focus on can be fluid, according to TS Lombard economist Dario Perkins.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“It is easy for tech enthusiasts to claim that ‘it’s different now’ and that fundamental valuations will never be the same again,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But some fundamentals are always important. For example, compared with the dot-com bubble, today’s AI giants have lower debt-to-earnings ratios than, say, WorldCom Inc. And companies like Nvidia and Meta Platforms are already reporting strong profit growth from AI, which wasn’t necessarily the case in the speculative era 25 years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The potential for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/oracle-credit-fear-gauge-hits-highest-since-2009-on-ai-bubble-fears\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">credit risk</a>&nbsp;in the AI trade is making some investors nervous. After <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/oracle/\" target=\"_blank\">Oracle</a> Corp. sold $18 billion in bonds on Sept. 24, the stock plunged 5.6% the next day and it’s down 37% since then. Meta, Alphabet and Oracle will need to raise $86 billion combined in 2026 alone, according to an estimate by <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/societe-generale/\" target=\"_blank\">Societe Generale</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Valuations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The S&amp;P 500’s valuation is the highest it’s ever been except for the early 2000s, at least according to its cyclically adjusted price-to-earnings ratio, a metric invented by economist Robert Shiller that divides a stock price by the average of its inflation-adjusted earnings over the past 10 years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bullish investors argue that while market valuations are rising because of tech, the pace of increase is much slower than the dot-com era. At one point in 2000, <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/cisco-systems/\" target=\"_blank\">Cisco Systems</a> Inc. was priced at over 200 times its previous 12 months of earnings, while Nvidia is at less than 50 times today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Stock prices decouple from earnings growth in an environment where there’s no debate on valuations, according to Richard Clode, a fund manager at Janus Henderson. “We’re just not seeing that currently as yet,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/investor/\" target=\"_blank\">Investor</a> Scrutiny</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Discussions of a potential stock bubble percolated throughout the year but picked up significantly in November and December amid&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-24/burry-defends-his-nvidia-criticism-as-company-pushes-back\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">warnings</a>&nbsp;from investor Michael Burry and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-02/bank-of-england-warns-debt-fueled-spending-boom-could-unravel\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Bank of England</a>. More than 12,000 stories in November mentioned the phrase “AI bubble,” roughly equal to the prior ten months combined, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Investors see an AI bubble as the biggest “tail risk” event, a December poll by Bank of America showed. More than half of the respondents said the Magnificent Seven tech stocks were Wall Street’s most crowded trade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This contrasts with the dot-com bubble, when there was “complete excitement about the internet revolutionizing everything,” said Venu Krishna, head of US equity strategy at <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/barclays/\" target=\"_blank\">Barclays</a>. And the questions about whether AI investments will pay off are increasing as the debt issuance rises.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I wouldn’t brush it off, but I would generally think that scrutiny is healthy,” he said. “In fact, that scrutiny is what will prevent extreme moves like a crash.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/is-ai-boom-bubble-pop-tech-stocks-sp500-bull-run/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

Washington’s recent seizure and pursuit of tankers while it pressured Maduro’s regime helped curb output in the country’s critical&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-31/venezuela-oil-output-slows-25-in-orinoco-belt-under-us-pressure\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Orinoco Belt</a>&nbsp;by 25%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Production could rise by about 150,000 barrels a day within a few months if sanctions are lifted, but getting back to 2 million barrels a day or higher would require “massive reforms” and large investments from international oil companies, according to consultants at Kpler.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other geopolitical threats afflicting OPEC+ nations continue to simmer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tensions between Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, two of the coalition’s core Middle East heavyweights, have flared over their support for opposing factions in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-02/yemen-sees-clashes-airstrikes-as-saudi-uae-tensions-escalate\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">conflict in Yemen</a>. Last week a Saudi-led coalition carried out airstrikes against a rival group supported by the UAE.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Washington has sanctioned top producers in Russia following the invasion of Ukraine, a conflict that’s also taking a toll on flows from fellow OPEC+ producer, Kazakhstan. On Friday, Trump pledged to “rescue”&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-02/trump-says-us-ready-to-rescue-iranian-protesters-if-attacked\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">protesters in Iran</a>, which has been rocked by a wave of demonstrations after the local currency collapsed to a record low.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nonetheless, world markets remain comfortably supplied for now.

Production in the US, Guyana, Brazil and Canada continues to climb while demand in top consumers like China has slowed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In April, Riyadh and its partners stunned crude traders by rapidly restarting production idled since 2023 despite signs that world markets were comfortably supplied. Several delegates said the move was intended to claw back market share ceded in recent years to rivals like American shale drillers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before the latest pause, OPEC+ had formally agreed to restore about two-thirds of 3.85 million barrels a day of output halted since 2023, leaving about 1.2 million barrels-a-day of these tranches left to restart.

Dozens of stores, restaurants and churches remained closed. Those on the streets looked shell-shocked, staring at their phones or into the distance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People are still shaken,” said 77-year-old David Leal, who arrived to work as a parking attendant but realized he likely would not have customers. He pointed to the deserted street, a few blocks from Venezuela’s presidential palace, which was guarded by armed civilians and military personnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">‘May God give us strength’</h4>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://apnews.com/photo-gallery/venezuela-us-explosions-caracas-maduro-9d8d5ec0fab172bf7bf7930e7594e244\">Venezuela</a>&nbsp;is no stranger to political tumult, but the the dead-of-night U.S. military operation early Saturday marked a new chapter with no ready script.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>U.S. President Donald Trump initially said the U.S. would “run” the country until there was stability, a remark that Secretary of State Marco Rubio&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-maduro-trump-military-operation-85041a1ec03bafe839b785a95169d694\">seemed to walk back on Sunday</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio insisted in interviews that Washington will use control of Venezuela’s oil industry to force policy changes, and called the government currently in place illegitimate. The country is home to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-oil-prices-trump-0c2c6ede79d550af53e6d3ddb51bfa04\">world’s largest proven crude oil reserves</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We want to see Venezuela transition to be a place completely different than what it looks like today. But obviously, we don’t have the expectation that’s going to happen in the next 15 hours,” Rubio said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Defense Minister Vladimir Padrino López, flanked by the high military command, told Venezuelans that Maduro was still the rightful leader. Presidential duties, however, now belong to Vice President Delcy Rodríguez, whom the high court ordered to assume the role of interim president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodríguez made no public comment Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maduro&#8217;s cadre of government officials demanded his release from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maduro-indictment-justice-department-trump-bondi-25a6fbd922472296c744eb5111cd914c\">custody</a>&nbsp;in New York, where his first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maduro-noriega-prosecution-legal-immunity-venezuela-panama-c0df9b1ecda36e9e1912729fa7ebf9e4\">court appearance</a>&nbsp;is set for Monday. State-controlled media did not air the images of him handcuffed on U.S. soil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuelans instead saw them on social media, and many could not believe their eyes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“May God give us strength for what we are experiencing. I’m sad. He is a human being,” said Nely Gutiérrez, a retiree, as her eyes welled with tears. “They have him handcuffed, and if he is in the hands of the empire, no one can save him from there, only God, not even God. He will die there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutiérrez had walked to church only to find it closed. She said she would have prayed for peace in Venezuela and for Maduro. She declined to say whether she ever voted for him but said, “The word of God says love your enemy.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Fear of celebrating</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>In the U.S. and some Latin American countries,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-military-action-95e557166a08a1b40aa0d8af507a8b99\">Maduro&#8217;s ouster was celebrated</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Venezuela, the scene was different, with some supporters burning U.S. flags and holding signs reading “Gringo go home.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Others muted any anti-Maduro feelings for now. Construction worker Daniel Medalla said people did not dare celebrate out of fear of government repression.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We were longing for it,” Medalla, 66, said of Maduro’s exit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Memories remain fresh of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/nicolas-maduro-political-prisoners-venezuela-election-president-b105d40ed698735f9c77f50f130b134e\">government crackdown</a>&nbsp;following the 2024 presidential election, which Maduro claimed to have won despite credible evidence that he lost by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Protests left 28 people dead, 220 injured and at least 2,000 detained, according to official figures.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The presence of police and military personnel across Caracas on Sunday was notable for its smaller size compared with an average day. Soldiers attempted to clear an area of an air base that burned along with at least three passenger buses during the U.S. attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio in interviews said no U.S. forces were on the ground in Venezuela but didn’t rule out further strikes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Death toll from US operation still unclear</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuelan officials have said Saturday’s operation killed civilians and military personnel. But they have not given a toll, and the government’s press office has not responded to multiple requests.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the coastal state of La Guaira, families with houses damaged during the operation were cleaning up debris.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wilman González, left with a black eye from a blast, picked through rubble at home, surrounded by broken furniture. One part of his apartment building was almost entirely blown off, leaving walls gaping.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Among those killed was González&#8217;s aunt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is it, what we are left with: ruins,” he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>González spoke with anger at the wreckage but also at the compounding economic and political crises that Venezuela has endured for decades.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We are civilians. We are not with the government or anyone else,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/venezuelan-people-celebration-maduro-capture-fear-government-repression/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

In particular, Trump&#8217;s comments about the U.S. positioning itself to “run” Venezuela have raised concerns that he is abandoning the “America First” philosophy that has long distinguished him from more traditional Republicans and helped fuel his political rise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“This is the same Washington playbook that we are so sick and tired of that doesn&#8217;t serve the American people, but actually serves the big corporations, the banks and the oil executives,” said Rep.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/marjorie-taylor-greene\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a>&nbsp;of Georgia, a former Trump ally who is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-georgia-republicans-f0e7f5f606cc63a0ccd57e429c05c762\">resigning on Monday</a>, in an interview with NBC&#8217;s “Meet the Press” on Sunday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those concerns were shared by some who are not associated with the party&#8217;s far-right flank.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, a moderate who is one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the November midterms, said in a statement that “the only country that the United States of America should be ‘running’ is the United States of America.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those comments reflect the sensitive dynamics between Trump and his fellow Republicans at the outset of an election year in which their party risks losing control of Congress. While the president&#8217;s dominance remains undisputed, the ironclad grip that he has held over the party has faced unusual challenges in recent months. Blocs of Republicans have banded together to pressure Trump to release the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/jeffrey-epstein\">Jeffrey Epstein files</a>. Others have been vocal in encouraging Trump to take&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-economy-2026-election-allentown-republicans-ccfc8351c2c081693ce763c1be34e749\">concerns about affordability</a>&nbsp;more seriously.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump’s aggressive vision of U.S. dominance</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Few issues are as central to Trump&#8217;s political brand as ensuring that the U.S. does not get entangled in seemingly endless foreign conflicts at the expense of domestic goals. During a 2016 Republican presidential debate, for instance, he described the war in Iraq as a “big, fat mistake.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on Saturday, Trump said he was “not afraid of boots on the ground” in Venezuela if that was deemed necessary, and he framed his actions as prioritizing the safety and security of Americans. He articulated an aggressive vision of U.S. dominance in the Western Hemisphere, and he told reporters it was important to “surround ourselves with good neighbors.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, much like the Iraq War, a president&#8217;s early confidence after a dramatic military action can sometimes meet more sobering realities that drain domestic political support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In Venezuela, U.S. troops could be placed in harm&#8217;s way again as Trump warns that more military operations may be in the works. An ongoing conflict could worsen the hemisphere&#8217;s refugee crisis, something the White House has tried to tamp down with stricter border controls. In addition, there are questions about how much cooperation the U.S. will receive from officials still in Venezuela or how easily the country&#8217;s oil reserves could be tapped to fulfill Trump&#8217;s goal of extracting more energy with Maduro out of the picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s comments this weekend about revitalizing the oil industry in Venezuela are in line with some of the earliest critiques he made of the handling of the Iraq War. During a 2013 speech before the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump said the U.S. should “take” oil from Iraq and “pay ourselves back.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Frustration with the handling of the Iraq War contributed to major gains for Democrats in the 2006 election and helped create the conditions for Barack Obama to be elected to the presidency two years later. Given the baggage surrounding those wars, Trump allies insist that the actions this weekend in Venezuela are different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“Venezuela looks nothing like Libya,” Secretary of State <a href=\"https://apnews.com/hub/marco-rubio\">Marco Rubio</a> said on “Meet the Press. “It looks nothing like Iraq. It looks nothing like Afghanistan. It looks nothing like the Middle East other than the Iranian agents that are running through there plotting against America, okay?”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Tom Cotton argued that the 1989 ouster of Manuel Noriega in Panama is a better comparison.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“That was a successful operation,” Cotton said on CNN&#8217;s “State of the Union.” “I believe, in the long run, this will be too.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, amid some of the pushback about the U.S. taking expansive responsibility for managing Venezuela, Rubio suggested a more limited role. He said that Washington would not handle day-to-day governance of the South American country other than enforcing an existing “oil quarantine” on Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">There&#8217;s not much organized GOP opposition to the strikes</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>It is not clear that any forceful, organized opposition to Trump&#8217;s Venezuela policy is emerging within the GOP. Instead, many lawmakers appear to be giving the Republican administration some room and, at most, offer some warnings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, who faces a potentially challenging reelection campaign this year, called Maduro a “narco-terrorist and international drug trafficker” who should stand trial even, as she said “Congress should have been informed about the operation earlier and needs to be involved as this situation evolves.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, who often criticizes military interventions, did not specifically oppose Trump&#8217;s actions. He wrote on social media that “time will tell if regime change in Venezuela is successful without significant monetary or human cost.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many Democrats denounced Trump&#8217;s actions in Venezuela and the Democratic National Committee quickly sought to raise money by blasting “another unconstitutional war from Trump.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez, D-N.Y., rejected the administration&#8217;s argument that it was combating drug crimes, saying on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/twitter/\" target=\"_blank\">X</a> that the White House is instead focused on “oil and regime change” while seeking to “to distract from Epstein + skyrocketing healthcare costs.” Former Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the strike was part of an “old and obvious pattern” where an “unpopular president — failing on the economy and losing his grip on power at home — decides to launch a war for regime change abroad.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/republican-isolation-trump-iraq-war-us-troops-venezuela-maduro/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

They stood in contrast to Trump’s broad but vague claims that the U.S. would at least temporarily “run” the oil-rich nation, comments that suggested some sort of governing structure under which Caracas would be controlled by Washington.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio offered a more nuanced take, saying the U.S. would continue to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-venezuela-maduro-sanctioned-oil-blockade-fd8fd9aa3da41f826fbabd8752dc9a17\">enforce an oil quarantine</a>&nbsp;that was already in place on sanctioned tankers before Maduro was removed from power early Saturday and use that leverage as a means to press policy changes in Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“And so that’s the sort of control the president is pointing to when he says that,&#8221; Rubio said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” &#8220;We continue with that quarantine, and we expect to see that there will be changes, not just in the way the oil industry is run for the benefit of the people, but also so that they stop the drug trafficking.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The blockade on sanctioned oil tankers —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tanker-seized-venezuela-maduro-0a148ba01684fc6ce1a228dd276732c0\">some of which have been seized by the U.S.</a>&nbsp;— “remains in place, and that’s a tremendous amount of leverage that will continue to be in place until we see changes that not just further the national interest of the United States, which is number one, but also that lead to a better future for the people of Venezuela,” he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leaders in Venezuela have so far pushed back, at least publicly, calling on the Trump administration to release Maduro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even before the operation that nabbed Maduro, experts were already questioning the legality of aspects of the administration&#8217;s pressure campaign on Venezuela, including the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-maduro-venezuela-drug-cartels-military-timeline-91e242e5c56eec39b6b7d72bf55dbd2d\">deadly bombing of boats</a>&nbsp;accused of trafficking drugs that some scholars said stretched the boundaries of international law.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Trump repeated vow US would ‘run’ Venezuela</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump&#8217;s vow to “run” Venezuela, repeated more than half a dozen times at a news conference in Florida on Saturday, sparked concerns among some Democrats. It also drew unease from parts of his own Republican coalition, including an “America First” base that is opposed to foreign interventions, and also from observers who recalled past nation-building efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio dismissed such criticism, saying that Trump’s intent had been misunderstood.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“The whole foreign policy apparatus thinks everything is Libya, everything is Iraq, everything is Afghanistan,” Rubio said. &#8220;This is not the Middle East. And our mission here is very different. This is the Western Hemisphere.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio also suggested the U.S. would give Maduro’s subordinates now in charge time to govern, saying, “We’re going to judge everything by what they do.” And though he did not rule out boots on the ground in Venezuela, Rubio said the U.S, which has built up its presence in the region, was already capable of stopping drug boats and sanctioned tankers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A day earlier, Trump told reporters, “We’re going to run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition.” He later pointed to his national security team with him, including Rubio and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, and said it would be done for a period of time by “the people that are standing right behind me. We’re gonna be running it we’re gonna be bringing it back.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The White House declined to comment beyond what Trump said Saturday.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Maduro&#8217;s arrival</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Maduro landed late Saturday afternoon at a small airport in New York City&#8217;s northern suburbs following the middle-of-the-night&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-us-maduro-what-to-know-a57528ff315a7f70ed51a1721f5e0bc2\">operation that extracted him and his wife</a>, Cilia Flores, from their home in a military base in the capital city of Caracas — an act that Maduro’s government called “imperialist.” The couple faces U.S. charges of participating in a narco-terrorism conspiracy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The dramatic seizure of the Maduros capped an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-maduro-venezuela-drug-cartels-military-timeline-91e242e5c56eec39b6b7d72bf55dbd2d\">intensive Trump administration pressure campaign</a>&nbsp;on Venezuela’s autocratic leader and months of secret planning, resulting in the most assertive American action to achieve regime change since the 2003 invasion of Iraq.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/legal-questions-maduro-trump-venezuela-capture-congress-7c686106ae7ffc759e5a1726e1b85576\">Legal experts raised questions</a>&nbsp;about the lawfulness of the operation, which was done without congressional approval.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuela’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, demanded that the U.S. free Maduro and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/venezuela-trump-maduro-military-rodriguez-lead-c0bd39f98a79c18c5501bac939c640fe\">called him the country’s rightful leader</a>&nbsp;as her nation’s high court named her interim president. So did the country&#8217;s defense minister, General-in-Chief Vladimir Padrino López, who said Sunday that the country&#8217;s armed forces “categorically reject the cowardly kidnapping.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maduro is due to make his first appearance Monday in Manhattan&#8217;s federal court.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maduro and other Venezuelan officials were indicted in 2020 on narco-terrorism conspiracy charges, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maduro-indictment-justice-department-trump-bondi-25a6fbd922472296c744eb5111cd914c\">Justice Department released a new indictment</a>&nbsp;Saturday of Maduro and his wife that painted his administration as a “corrupt, illegitimate government” fueled by a drug-trafficking operation that flooded the U.S with cocaine. The U.S. government does not recognize Maduro as the country’s leader.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Trump administration spent months building up American forces in the region and carrying out attacks on boats in the Caribbean <a href=\"https://fortune.com/company/sea/\" target=\"_blank\">Sea</a> and eastern Pacific Ocean for allegedly ferrying drugs. Last week, the CIA was behind a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-venezuela-facility-boat-strikes-0faff66145c6706e2861fcde36756fe4\">drone strike</a>&nbsp;at a docking area believed to have been used by Venezuelan drug cartels — the first known direct operation on Venezuelan soil since the U.S. campaign began in September.</p>\n\n\n\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Quiet falls in Venezuela after US operation</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>Venezuela’s capital&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/maduro-venezuela-caracas-us-a3607a328dbecaa30edc69ae6cc238ee\">remained unusually quiet</a>&nbsp;Sunday with few vehicles moving around and convenience stores, gas stations and other businesses closed. A road typically filled with runners, cyclists and other fitness enthusiasts on Sundays only had a handful of people working out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The presidential palace was guarded by armed civilians and members of the military. At a nearby plaza, only a street sweeper and a soldier stood, and across the street, a church remained close for a second day in a row.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Under Venezuelan law, Rodríguez would take over from Maduro. Rodriguez, however, stressed during a Saturday appearance on state television that she did not plan to assume power, before Venezuela’s high court ordered that she assume the interim role. Trump told The Atlantic in an interview Sunday that Rodríguez could “pay a very big price” if she doesn’t do what he thinks is right for Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That contrasted with the Republican president’s comments about Rodríguez on Saturday when he said Rubio had spoken with her and she was willing to do what the U.S. thinks is needed to improve the standard of living in Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump told the magazine that “if she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump told the New York Post in an interview Saturday that the U.S. wouldn’t need to station troops in Venezuela if she “does what we want.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Caracas resident David Leal arrived to the lot where he parks vehicles for a living only to quickly realize that he would likely not see any clients for a second day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“People are still shaken,” said Leal, 77.</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/marco-rubio-us-control-venezuela-day-to-day-oil-quarantine/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

      "content": "\n<p>After the U.S. military arrested Nicolas Maduro and sent him to New York to face criminal charges, Delcy Rodríguez became Venezuela&#8217;s de facto leader and was identified by President Donald Trump as the key enabler of his policy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During a press briefing on Saturday, he said <a class=\"\" href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/03/trump-us-control-maduro-rubio-venezuela-us-troops-boots-on-the-ground/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">“we’re going to run”</a> the country to allow for a transition to new leadership, claiming Rodríguez is “essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again” and will take orders from the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Rodríguez, 56, remained defiant, demanding the release of Maduro and saying Venezuela will never be a colony again. Trump then <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-venezuela-maduro-delcy-rodriguez/685497/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-venezuela-maduro-delcy-rodriguez/685497/\">told the <em>Atlantic</em></a> that &#8220;if she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Iria Puyosa, a senior research fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Democracy+Tech Initiative and a former professor at the Central University of Venezuela, warned Rodríguez doesn&#8217;t appear to have support from all factions in the ruling party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Rodríguez cannot guarantee the stability required for the business operations Trump emphasized several times during his remarks on the operation,&#8221; Puyosa <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/dispatches/us-just-captured-maduro-whats-next-for-venezuela-and-the-region/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/dispatches/us-just-captured-maduro-whats-next-for-venezuela-and-the-region/\">wrote in a blog post</a>.&nbsp;&#8220;<em>Chavismo</em>&nbsp;no longer enjoys the widespread popular support it had two decades ago.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Her rise to power caps a career climbing the ranks of the Venezuelan government. When Maduro was captured, she was serving as oil minister in addition to her role as vice president.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rodríguez was born in Caracas into a politically active left‑wing family and studied law at the Central University of Venezuela, with brief stint focusing on labor law in France. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She entered government in the early 2000s during Hugo Chávez’s presidency, starting in technical and advisory roles. But her career really took off after his death in 2013. Once Maduro assumed power, Rodríguez was named communications minister. Then she served as foreign minister from 2014 to 2017. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, Rodríguez became president of the Constituent National Assembly and effectively sidelined the opposition‑led legislature. Maduro named her as his vice president and head of a Venezuelan intelligence agency in 2018. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>She added economy minister to her portfolio in 2020 after Venezuela had suffered through years of calamity. While high oil prices propped up the country during the Chávez regime, crude tumbled in 2014. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mismanagement, high inflation, U.S. sanctions, and underinvestment in the oil industry added to the economy&#8217;s woes, forcing millions of Venezuelans to flee the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite being a longtime socialist, Rodríguez also had a reputation as a technocrat and turned to market-friendly reforms to try to pull the economy out of its tailspin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, she privatized some state assets and pursued a fiscal policy that was relatively more conservative than before. Rodríguez also became friendlier with business leaders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, the economy remains a mess and has shrunk by 80% since Maduro became president in 2013. Meanwhile, Venezuela&#8217;s oil infrastructure has fallen into disrepair and output has crumbled.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Despite having the world&#8217;s largest proven oil reserves, production has plunged to about 960,000 barrels a day from 3.2 million barrels daily in 2000 and a peak of nearly 4 million.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump aims to turn that around and predicted Maduro&#8217;s ouster will unleash a flood of investment in Venezuela from U.S. oil companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“We’re going to rebuild the oil infrastructure, which will cost billions of dollars,” he told reporters on Saturday. “It’ll be paid for by the oil companies directly, and they will be reimbursed for what they’re doing. But it’s going to be paid, and we’re going to get the oil flowing.”</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/venezuela-new-leader-delcy-rodriguez-nicolas-maduro-socialist-market-reforms-economic-collapse/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",

We have plenty of oil in the United States. What we&#8217;re not going to allow is for the oil industry in Venezuela to be controlled by adversaries of the United States,&#8221; he replied, naming Russia, China and Iran.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is the Western Hemisphere. This is where we live. And we&#8217;re not going to allow the Western Hemisphere to be a base of operations for adversaries, competitors, and rivals of the United States, simple as that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio also said the U.S. wants to see Venezuela&#8217;s oil wealth benefiting the people. During Maduro&#8217;s rule, the regime and its cronies enriched themselves with oil, contributing to the an economic collapse and the mass exodus of people out of the country, he added. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, the U.S. has left Maduro&#8217;s top lieutenants in place, and Trump suggested Venezuela&#8217;s interim president, Delcy Rodriguez, will take orders from the U.S.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if the country&#8217;s current leaders don&#8217;t cooperate, Trump has left open the possibility that he could send U.S. ground troops into Venezuela.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked in a separate <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-secretary-of-state-face-the-nation-transcript-01-04-2026/\" data-type=\"link\" data-id=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/marco-rubio-secretary-of-state-face-the-nation-transcript-01-04-2026/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interview on CBS&#8217;s <em>Face the Nation</em></a> if there is no plan for a U.S. occupation of Venezuela, Rubio declined to rule that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Well, I think first of all, the president always retains optionality on anything and on all these matters,&#8221; he said. &#8220;He certainly has the ability and the right under the Constitution of the United States to act against imminent and urgent threats against the country.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For now, U.S. forces remain in the region at a high state of readiness, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Dan Caine said Saturday. Trump also said U.S. sanctions will stay in place on Venezuelan oil.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rubio explained that the sanctions are aimed at &#8220;paralyzing that portion of how the regime generates revenue.&#8221; He also dismissed fears about boots on the ground as an &#8220;obsession.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Trump &#8220;does not feel like he is going to publicly rule out options that are available for the United States, even though that&#8217;s not what you&#8217;re seeing right now,&#8221; Rubio added. &#8220;What you&#8217;re seeing right now is an oil quarantine that allows us to exert tremendous leverage over what happens next.&#8221;</p>\n<p>This story was originally featured on <a href=\"https://fortune.com/2026/01/04/marco-rubio-venezuelan-oil-us-adversaries-control-trump-occupation-troops/\" target=\"_blank\">Fortune.com</a></p>",
