Although the full circumstances of the killing remain unclear, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K9CJY5p0xz4&amp;rco=1\">video of the shooting</a> shows an officer opening fire on the woman as she drove away.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realistically, there’s virtually no chance that President Donald Trump’s Justice Department will bring federal charges against the officer who killed this woman. Trump already claimed on TruthSocial, his personal social media site, that the officer shot the woman in “<a href=\"https://x.com/atrupar/status/2008999501088891357?s=20\">self defense</a>.” (The officer could potentially be prosecuted after Trump leaves office.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But many local officials are quite upset about this incident. Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey gave a press conference Wednesday afternoon where he told US Immigration and Customs Enforcement to “<a href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/07/ice-officer-fatally-shoots-driver-through-car-window-in-minneapolis/\">get the fuck out of Minneapolis</a>.” If further investigations reveal that the shooting was not legally justified, state prosecutors could potentially charge the officer responsible with a homicide crime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Supreme Court’s Republican majority has made it <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/417612/supreme-court-bivens-ice-law-enforcement-donald-trump\">very difficult for private citizens to sue federal law enforcement officers</a> who break the law. But can a federal officer actually be charged with, and convicted of, violating a state criminal law?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Until fairly recently, the law was favorable to federal officials who allegedly violate state criminal laws while they carry out their official duties. The seminal case, known as <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/135/1/\"><em>In re Neagle</em></a> (1890), held that a deputy US marshall who shot and killed a man could not be charged with murder in state court, because this federal officer did so while acting as a bodyguard for a US Supreme Court justice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last June, however, the Supreme Court handed down <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-362_mjn0.pdf\"><em>Martin v. United States</em></a> (2025), which held that <em>Neagle</em> does not always protect federal officials who violate state law. The rule announced in <em>Martin </em>is vague, so it is unclear how it would apply to the shooting in Minneapolis. But the gist of the ruling is that a federal officer is only protected if they can demonstrate that “their actions, though criminal under state law, were ‘necessary and proper’ in the discharge of their federal responsibilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If the officer responsible for the Minneapolis killing broke Minnesota law, in other words, any prosecution against them would turn on whether the courts decide shooting this woman was a “necessary and proper” exercise of the officer’s official duties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is one other potential complication. A federal law provides that state criminal charges against “any officer (or any person acting under that officer) of the United States or any agency thereof” may be <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/28/1442\">removed from state court and heard by a federal judge</a>. This statute does not prevent state prosecutors from bringing charges or from prosecuting a case. But it does ensure that the question of whether <em>Neagle</em> applies to this case would be decided by federal courts that are increasingly dominated by conservative Republicans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Federal cases out of Minnesota appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, a very conservative court where <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Eighth_Circuit\">10 of the 11 active judges were appointed by Republicans</a>. And, of course, any decision by the Eighth Circuit might be appealed to the Supreme Court, where Republicans control six of the nine seats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of which is a long way of saying that, while the law does not absolutely preclude Minnesota prosecutors from filing charges against this officer, it is far from clear that those charges will stick.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">When are federal officers immune from prosecution in state court?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The facts underlying the <em>Neagle </em>case are <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-362_mjn0.pdf\">simply wild</a>. David Terry was a lawyer and former chief justice of the state of California, who had served with US Supreme Court Justice Stephen Field while the two were both state supreme court justices. At the time, federal justices were required to “ride circuit” and hear cases outside of Washington, DC. And so, Field wound up hearing a dispute about whether Terry’s wife was entitled to a share of a US senator’s fortune.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the court proceeding, where Field ruled against Terry’s wife, Terry punched a US marshal, brandished a bowie knife, and was jailed for contempt of court. After his release, he and his wife continued to threaten Field’s life, and so, the attorney general ordered Deputy Marshal David Neagle to act as Field’s bodyguard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, Terry attacked Field while Field was traveling through California by train, and Neagle shot and killed Terry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given these facts, it’s unsurprising that the Supreme Court ruled that California could not bring charges against Neagle for this killing. The case involved a physical attack on a sitting justice! And, besides, Neagle acted within the scope of his responsibilities as Field’s federally appointed bodyguard.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">135 years later, however, the Court decided <em>Martin.</em> That more recent decision focused on language in the <em>Neagle</em> opinion that suggested that its scope may be limited. <em>Neagle</em>, Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote in <em>Martin</em>, arose from concerns that “California could frustrate federal law by prosecuting a federal marshal “for an act which he was authorized to do by the law of the United States.” Protecting Field was something that “it was [Neagle’s] duty to do.” And, in shooting Terry, Neagle “did no more than what was necessary and proper.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, Gorsuch extracted a rule from <em>Neagle</em> that federal officials are only protected from state law when their actions “were ‘<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24-362_mjn0.pdf\">necessary and proper</a>’ in the discharge of their federal responsibilities.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of <em>Martin</em>, Minnesota may very well be able to prosecute the officer responsible for the Minnesota killing. As a general rule, federal law enforcement officers are not authorized by the law of the United States to shoot people without justification. So, if it turns out that this killing was legally unjustified, federal courts may conclude that the officer’s actions were not necessary and proper in the discharge of his official duties.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That said, <em>Martin</em> is a fairly new opinion, and the rule it announced is vague. And any prosecution against a federal immigration officer would be unavoidably political. So, it is unclear whether the judges who hear this case would approach it as fair and impartial jurists or as partisans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The bottom line, in other words, is that the law governing when federal officers may be charged with state crimes is quite unclear. So, it is uncertain whether a prosecution against this particular officer would succeed — even assuming that a state prosecutor could convince a jury to convict.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

What we do know is based on <a href=\"https://minnesotareformer.com/2026/01/07/ice-officer-fatally-shoots-driver-through-car-window-in-minneapolis/\">local reporting</a> collecting video and eyewitness accounts from the scene, including multiple angles of the shooting:&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The shooting occurred as a vehicle attempted to drive away from federal immigration officers; at least one officer fired multiple shots at close range into the driver’s side of the vehicle, causing it to crash a short distance away.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The driver of the vehicle was shot and killed, Minneapolis officials and the Department of Homeland Security have both confirmed.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the context?</strong> This kind of violence has seemed all but inevitable since federal immigration officials began military-style deployments to US cities last year, resulting in a tide of videos capturing excessive use of force against Americans by immigration agents.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In one similar incident last year, Customs and Border Protection agents in Chicago shot a woman who the government initially accused of “ambushing” them, only for the case to later be <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/US/doj-drops-charges-2-people-accused-ramming-vehicles/story?id=127714651\">dismissed with prejudice</a> at the request of the Justice Department, meaning it cannot be brought again. The woman survived.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also the question of accountability, or the lack thereof: <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/464962/supreme-court-ice-no-law\">As Vox’s Ian Millhiser reports</a>, the Supreme Court has repeatedly acted to place ICE and other immigration agents above the law even in cases of clearly egregious, violent conduct toward bystanders and peaceful protesters.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How is the Trump administration responding?</strong> In confirming the shooting, DHS officials, including Secretary Kristi Noem, have described it as “an act of domestic terrorism” and an attack on ICE officers. It’s important to emphasize that Noem’s characterization of the shooting is not supported by the limited video of the incident.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, it’s also consistent with a narrative that the administration has attempted to drive in public statements and court filings, one that portrays federal immigration officers as constantly under threat. <a href=\"https://www.loevy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CHC-v.-Noem-281.-Opinion-and-Order-for-PI.pdf\">In at least one instance</a>, that narrative has been explicitly debunked by a federal court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why was ICE in Minneapolis?</strong> The DHS presence in Minneapolis, which administration officials have <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/homeland-security-kristi-noem-minnesota-twin-cities-immigration-arrests/?intcid=CNR-01-0623\">described</a> as the “largest immigration operation ever,” comes after weeks of Republican outrage focused on Minnesota and Minneapolis immigrant communities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most recently, right-wing media has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/474328/minnesota-fraud-tim-walz-daycare-child-care\">seized on a welfare fraud scandal in Minnesota as an opportunity for viral content</a>; most of the alleged perpetrators charged in the scandal are Somali Americans, and President Donald Trump and others have used the story to attack Minneapolis’s Somali community writ large. (The Twin Cities area, including Minneapolis, is home to the largest population of Somali immigrants in the US.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In December, <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/02/nx-s1-5629305/trump-says-he-doesnt-want-somalis-in-the-u-s-urges-them-to-go-back-to-their-homeland-and-fix-it\">Trump attacked Somali immigrants</a> in a Cabinet meeting, calling them “garbage” and telling reporters that “I don&#8217;t want them in our country.” He also described Minnesota as “a hub of fraudulent money laundering activity.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Jefferson</em></a>, is indirectly related to Trump’s attempt to get <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-logoff-newsletter-trump/470336/comey-james-cases-lindsey-halligan-us-attorney-kelly-investigation\">revenge against two of his perceived political enemies</a>: former FBI Director James Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last September, Trump ousted Erik Siebert, formerly the US attorney for the eastern half of Virginia, after <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/20/us/politics/trump-justice-department-us-attorneys.html\">demanding that the Justice Department bring charges</a> against Comey, James, and Sen. Adam Schiff (D-CA). He then purported to install Lindsey Halligan, one of his former personal attorneys, as the top federal prosecutor in eastern Virginia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Prior to this assignment, Halligan worked as an insurance lawyer and had not been a prosecutor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Halligan swiftly complied with Trump’s demand and brought charges against Comey and James, but those charges were dismissed after federal Judge Cameron Currie determined that she was <a href=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/federal-judge-dismisses-comey-and-james-indictments\">illegally appointed as US attorney</a>. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The gist of <a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26299826-james-dismissal/\">Currie’s decision</a> is that federal law permits the attorney general to temporarily fill vacant US attorney jobs for 120 days, but the Justice Department already used this authority to appoint Siebert at the beginning of Trump’s second term. That means that any new presidential appointment must be confirmed by the Senate, and Halligan was never confirmed.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And that brings us back to Judge David Novak’s <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.vaed.586311/gov.uscourts.vaed.586311.16.0.pdf\">Tuesday order</a> in<em> United States v. Jefferson</em>. In it, Novak “observes that Ms. Halligan identified herself” in a recent court filing “as the United States Attorney for this District.” And he faults her for doing so despite Currie’s previous decision. Novak, who was appointed to the federal bench by Trump in 2019, orders Halligan to file a new document “explaining the basis for Ms. Halligan’s identification of herself as the United States Attorney, notwithstanding Judge Currie’s contrary ruling.”</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>More broadly, Novak’s order reflects a growing trend of federal judges doubting whether the Justice Department’s in-court statements can be trusted.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly half of Novak’s roughly two-page order consists of a long citation quoting various ethical rules and standards of professional conduct that Halligan may have violated by continuing to represent herself as a US attorney. Among other things, Novak quotes a Virginia rule providing that lawyers may not knowingly “make a false statement of fact or law to a tribunal,” and another providing that it is “professional misconduct for a lawyer to” engage in dishonest conduct that “reflects adversely on the lawyer’s fitness to practice law.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The most ominous quote in Novak’s list of disciplinary rules, at least for Halligan, is his citation to a judicial opinion holding that “Federal courts have the inherent power to control the admission of attorneys to their bars and to discipline attorneys who appear before them.” So Novak isn’t just threatening to discipline Halligan. He explicitly raised the possibility that she could be disbarred from practicing within the federal judiciary’s eastern Virginia district.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More broadly, Novak’s order reflects a growing trend of federal judges doubting whether the Department of Justice’s in-court statements can be trusted. If the judiciary comes to view DOJ as untrustworthy, that could seriously damage the federal government’s ability to enforce the law.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Why the fight over Halligan matters</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currie’s order holding that Halligan was never US attorney, and Novak’s subsequent threat to discipline Halligan, are among several high-profile embarrassments for Trump’s DOJ. Halligan isn’t even the only US attorney appointee who was removed by a federal court. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last month, a federal appeals court affirmed a lower court decision holding that Alina Habba, another one of Trump’s personal lawyers that his administration tried to install as the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey, <a href=\"https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818/gov.uscourts.ca3.125818.81.0.pdf\">could not serve in that role past the 120-day deadline</a> that federal law sets for temporary US attorneys. During her brief time in office, Habba began a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/criminal-justice/420816/alina-habba-new-jersey-donald-trump-us-attorney\">failed prosecution against Newark’s Democratic Mayor Ras Baraka</a>, dropped those charges after they were criticized by a federal magistrate judge, and then <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/462869/lamonica-mciver-prosecution-trump-authoritarianism\">initiated a new prosecution against Democratic US Rep. LaMonica McIver</a> for attempting to shield Baraka from arrest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Trump’s Justice Department has struggled to get many attempted prosecutions off the ground.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the federal system, prosecutors typically must seek an indictment from a grand jury before they can bring felony charges. But there’s an old joke that it is so easy for prosecutors to obtain such an indictment that they could <a href=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/a-grand-jury-would-indict-a-ham-4139800/\">successfully bring charges against a ham sandwich</a> if they wanted to. Grand juries typically hear one-sided cases because the prosecution may present its evidence, but defense counsel ordinarily does not get to make its case until their client is tried.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under Trump, however, the Justice Department sometimes struggles to overcome what used to be a very low hurdle. Last September, for example, the New York Times reported that grand juries in Washington, DC, alone <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/06/us/trump-dc-national-guard-grand-juries-crime.html\">refused to allow seven criminal cases to move forward</a> — including a case where the Justice Department was unable to secure an indictment three times against the same defendant. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">By comparison, in 2016, the last year that the Justice Department published data on this matter, federal prosecutors investigated over 155,000 criminal matters. <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/07/trump-grand-juries-letitia-james-comey-indictments-00713579\">Only six of those cases</a> ended after a grand jury refused to indict a suspect.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nor is <em>United States v. Jefferson</em> the only case where a federal judge accused the Trump administration of making false statements in court. In a high-profile case challenging Trump’s attempt to use the National Guard to suppress a protest outside of Chicago, for example, a federal judge wrote that the Trump administration’s claim that the protesters presented a serious threat to public safety was “<a href=\"https://www.loevy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CHC-v.-Noem-281.-Opinion-and-Order-for-PI.pdf\">simply not credible</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These embarrassments matter because they undercut one of the Justice Department’s most important assets: its credibility with federal courts. Historically, DOJ has tried very hard to cultivate a reputation for honesty with judges, even <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/confession-error-solicitor-generals-mistakes-during-japanese-american-internment-cases\">confessing error</a> when it discovers that it has misrepresented a fact to a court. It does so because the Justice Department is a party to so many federal cases that it would find it very difficult to operate if judges started questioning whether DOJ lawyers are being honest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus far, for what it is worth, the most important court in the country still gives an extraordinary amount of deference to the Trump administration. Last month, for example, the Supreme Court’s Republican majority <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/471368/supreme-court-texas-gerrymander-abbott-lulac\">reinstated the GOP’s Texas gerrymander</a> after a lower court struck it down. The lower court’s order <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/469426/texas-gerrymander-struck-down-race-supreme-court\">relied on a letter from Trump’s Justice Department</a> that indicated that the gerrymander was enacted in order to change the racial makeup of several congressional districts, something the Constitution typically does not permit.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, while the Supreme Court’s Republican majority may bail out Trump’s Justice Department in highly political cases such as the dispute over Texas’s gerrymander, the Supreme Court only hears a tiny percentage of federal court cases. The overwhelming majority of these cases involve apolitical prosecutions or civil matters that rarely make headlines — and that will never receive any attention from the justices.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And these ordinary matters are the ones where the Justice Department’s credibility matters the most. If judges can’t trust DOJ’s lawyers, then that most likely means that more people who actually committed federal crimes will dodge the charges against them. If nothing else, it means that Justice Department lawyers will have to spend countless hours shoring up factual claims that judges simply would have believed in the past. And that’s time that DOJ lawyers can’t spend bringing additional prosecutions or enforcing other federal laws.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nor is it clear that DOJ will regain its reputation for truth-telling in a future administration. While Trump will no longer be in office in 2029 (barring an unconstitutional third term), many of the lawyers hired during his administration will still work at the DOJ after he leaves. And once a judge grows accustomed to viewing federal prosecutors as untrustworthy, they may not change that view just because there’s a new president.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus Trump, and the cronies he’s appointed to the Justice Department, may have done permanent damage to the federal government’s ability to enforce the law.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

He rings doorbells, pulls on doors, and sometimes claims to be a parent hoping to register his child, “Little Joey.” When he’s not admitted, he claims the centers are fake, with no children inside. All the while, a ticker at the bottom of the screen tallies up millions of dollars in alleged graft.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“When I look at the world as a whole, and I look at fraud, the Twin Cities is ground zero,” one of Shirley’s associates said at one point. “The fraud is worse here than anywhere else ever in history.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The video does not actually provide direct evidence of fraud. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/us/minnesota-child-care-fraud-investigation\">State investigators visited the centers</a> Shirley highlighted and found children at all but one, which was not yet open for families. But Shirley’s purported exposé, viewed over 3 million times, has started a wave of outrage among right-wing lawmakers already focused on allegations of <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/29/us/fraud-minnesota-somali.html\">social services fraud in Somali immigrant communities in Minnesota</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Now, the Trump administration has announced a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/us/politics/child-care-funding-cuts-trump.html\">freeze on federal child care funding</a> to five blue states, including Minnesota, along with <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-child-care-funds-fraud-trump-1d6edb8511d916fc3a5dc3b339d94e37\">increased reporting requirements for all states</a>. Providers around the country fear they may have to <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/04/nx-s1-5665040/child-care-providers-face-intense-scrutiny-amid-funding-cuts-and-allegations-of-fraud\">close their doors and lay off staff</a>, and parents are worried about how <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/01/us/minnesota-child-care-funding-impact-fraud.html\">their lives might be upended</a> if they lose child care.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Having disruptions like this is really counterproductive for children, for parents who are trying to go to work, and for the really underpaid, and stressed, and strained child care workforce,” said Amy Matsui, vice president of child care and income security at the National Women&#8217;s Law Center.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">How did unsubstantiated claims of child care fraud go from a YouTube video to <a href=\"https://familyfrontier.substack.com/p/the-new-years-child-care-freeze-a\">influencing federal policy</a> in a matter of days? The answer lies at the intersection of actual pandemic-era fraud cases, a right-wing media ecosystem eager for anti-immigrant content, and a longstanding conservative antipathy toward subsidized day care. But the politics of early childhood in America are also changing, and the White House response to Shirley’s video could create blowback that the Trump administration didn’t anticipate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Minnesota’s welfare fraud scandal, explained&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The current controversy over child care centers in Minnesota <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/29/us/fraud-minnesota-somali.html\">has its roots in 2022</a>, when federal prosecutors charged <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/pr/us-attorney-announces-federal-charges-against-47-defendants-250-million-feeding-our-future\">47 people</a> with fraudulently siphoning funds from a state program meant to feed hungry children during the pandemic. The scandal soon expanded to include providers charged with fraudulently billing the state for housing assistance and autism therapy services. Prosecutors say fraudsters may have stolen as much as <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/minnesota-fraud-charges-fbad68312012dc02a4060852474f72ee\">$9 billion</a>, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/politics/tim-walz-minnesota-reelection\">dropped his reelection bid</a> this week amid the scandal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most of those charged with fraud are part of Minnesota’s Somali community, the largest in the country. Most are also US citizens. The charges, filed during the Biden administration, have been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/470967/trump-immigration-ban-third-world-alt-right\">re-amplified by conservative activist Chris Rufo</a> and others in recent weeks and used to stoke racism and xenophobia toward all Somali immigrants. “I don’t want them in our country,” President Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2025/12/02/nx-s1-5629305/trump-says-he-doesnt-want-somalis-in-the-u-s-urges-them-to-go-back-to-their-homeland-and-fix-it\">said</a> in December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The recent federal fraud investigations that have garnered national attention did not have to do with child care centers. But now, thanks to Shirley’s video, the national spotlight is trained squarely on day cares.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the video, Shirley and an associate identified only as David claimed that day care centers run by members of the Somali community have “stolen” millions of dollars from the state of Minnesota. State governments, supported in part by the federal Child Care and Development Block Grant program, subsidize providers for caring for children from low-income families. It is presumably these subsidies that Shirley believes are being stolen.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The video, however, does not provide any direct evidence of theft. Child care centers often keep doors locked, allowing only families and staff to enter, for safety reasons. “I have a very hard time imagining why or how child care staff would be willing to let a random stranger into a location,” Matsui said. “I would not want my child care provider to be letting random YouTubers into a space where my children were.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">None of the people identified in public documents as owning the centers have been charged with fraud, <a href=\"https://www.startribune.com/day-care-fraud-minnesota-video/601554760\">according to an investigation by the Minneapolis Star Tribune</a> following up on Shirley’s video. While state investigations are ongoing, state officials who visited the centers after the video released said they were <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/us/minnesota-child-care-fraud-investigation\">operating normally</a>. Shirley has not responded to a request for comment from Vox.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There is no national database tracking child care fraud, but “as in any program, it’s not nonexistent,” said Daniel Hains, chief policy and professional advancement officer at the National Association for the Education of Young Children, a nonprofit that supports child care and early learning providers. Minnesota state auditors previously investigated claims of fraud in its child care programs and <a href=\"https://familyfrontier.substack.com/p/the-new-years-child-care-freeze-a\">identified some potential vulnerabilities</a> in 2019, leading to increased federal oversight and renewed focus from state lawmakers. Nationally, the federal government has also devoted attention to the topic. A <a href=\"https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-20-227\">2020 report</a> by the federal Government Accountability Office outlined nine recommendations for preventing fraud in the disbursement of child care subsidies, many of which states have followed, Hains said.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“There is huge public support for having greater public investment in child care. This is something that families want and need for their economic security.”</p><cite>Amy Matsui, vice president of child care and income security at the National Women’s Law Center</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the Trump administration has responded to Shirley’s video with a series of blanket funding freezes. In <a href=\"https://x.com/HHS_Jim/status/2006136004294664464\">a December 30 statement</a> praising Shirley’s “excellent work,” Deputy Health and Human Services Secretary Jim O’Neill announced, “We have frozen all child care payments to the state of Minnesota.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, on Monday, HHS officials <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/05/trump-child-care-minnesota\">told reporters</a> that the agency would freeze $10 billion in child care and food assistance funds for five blue states: California, Colorado, Illinois, Minnesota, and New York. “Democrat-led states and governors have been complicit in allowing massive amounts of fraud to occur under their watch,” HHS spokesperson Andrew Nixon <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/us/politics/child-care-funding-cuts-trump.html\">said in a statement</a>, although there is no evidence of major fraud in the other four states beyond Minnesota. The agency also says that child care payments to all states will now be subject to additional scrutiny.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">HHS describes the freeze as necessary in order to root out wrongdoing in the child care system. “These requirements help ensure the integrity of the program and protect both families and providers,” a spokesperson told me in an email.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even for experts in the child care space, the rollout of overlapping freeze announcements has been confusing. It’s not clear exactly what information will be required to restart payments or how requirements will differ by state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But states are likely to face delays in getting their federal funding, which could lead to delays in money paid to individual providers. Child care centers, which are often extremely small businesses, are ill-placed to weather such cash-flow disruptions. “Because providers are working on such small margins, it’s entirely possible that they might have to close, whether temporarily or permanently,” Matsui said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such closures put parents’ jobs at risk, Hains said. They also create risks for children if families have to turn to less-safe options, like leaving children home alone or with a sibling. Meanwhile, sudden disruptions in care can be harmful in themselves, Hains said. The relationship between children and their caregivers “is really formative and foundational, and it&#8217;s critical for young children&#8217;s healthy development to retain those sustained, nurturing relationships.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Child care centers around the country are facing fallout even beyond the funding freezes. HHS is also <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/05/nx-s1-5667019/hhs-child-care-federal-funding\">rescinding a Biden-era rule</a> that encouraged states to pay child care providers up front based on enrollment, rather than after the fact based on recorded attendance. Child care experts say a return to after-the-fact payments will make it harder for providers to plan and pay their bills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, a Minnesota day care center <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/us/somali-daycare-minnesota-broken-key-documents-stolen-overnight-burglary\">not featured</a> in the video <a href=\"https://www.mprnews.org/story/2025/12/31/somali-child-care-providers-report-vandalism-threats-after-viral-video\">experienced a break-in</a> and theft of enrollment records and other documents, and other day cares run by Somali Americans in the area have reported threats and harassment. <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/us/minnesota-child-care-fraud-investigation\">Copycat YouTubers</a> have been recording their own videos at day cares in states like Washington and Ohio.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It really is destabilizing and terrifying and not at all furthering the goal of enabling more families to have the child care they need,” Matsui said.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The politics of child care in 2026</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The episode has provided an opening for conservative lawmakers and <a href=\"https://x.com/ClayTravis/status/2006105591521951817?s=20&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">others</a> to question the very premise of subsidized child care. “When did it become the federal government’s role to provide day care?” Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY), known for his libertarian views, <a href=\"https://x.com/RepThomasMassie/status/2006160651287134584?s=20&amp;utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">asked on X</a> in December.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Efforts to expand public support for child care have also long run up against social conservatives’ concerns that more <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/21432940/child-care-bailout-covid-economy-work-parents-great-rebuild\">mothers should stay home with children</a>, an ideal that’s been embraced implicitly and explicitly by members of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy/417756/family-moms-mothers-jobs-maga-trump-vance-kids\">the Trump administration and the larger MAGA coalition</a>. The fact that a <a href=\"https://hechingerreport.org/americas-child-care-system-relies-on-immigrants-without-them-it-could-collapse/\">high percentage of child care workers are immigrants</a> also makes the sector highly vulnerable to an administration that’s increasingly comfortable with sweepingly anti-immigrant rhetoric and policy. The administration this week announced a <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/05/us/ice-minnesota-immigration-federal-agents-somali\">deployment of 2,000 federal agents</a> to Minnesota in an immigration operation apparently aimed at the Somali community.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s nothing the Trump administration would like to talk about more than a crackdown on fraud tied to immigrant communities. But the pivot to disrupting child care on a potentially massive scale also comes at a time when there’s public momentum behind reducing costs for families with young children —&nbsp;a more politically sensitive topic for the White House.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Publicly funded child care is on an upswing in America, with <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/us-first-new-mexico-launches-free-child-care-rcna241516\">New Mexico</a> recently becoming the first state to offer universal child care. In New York City, universal child care was part of Mayor Zohran Mamdani’s <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/opinion/mamdani-child-care-plan-nyc.html\">affordability pitch</a> to voters — one <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/20/upshot/affordability-democrats-trump.html\">both parties are attempting to emulate</a>. Polling also shows voters are interested in Washington doing more to help those efforts; one AP-NORC survey last year found 64 percent of US adults favored <a href=\"https://apnorc.org/projects/few-concerned-with-declining-birthrates-but-many-worry-about-the-costs-of-child-care-and-favor-paid-family-leave/\">federal help for providing low-cost or free day care</a>, including 51 percent of Republicans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is huge public support for having greater public investment in child care,” Matsui said. “This is something that families want and need for their economic security.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There was a time when freezing public funding for day care centers might have been an easy political win for Trump. But today, a move that drives up the cost of living for families around the country may be less popular than the administration imagines.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But on Monday, the CDC scrapped that longstanding guidance as part of an unprecedented overhaul of its vaccine recommendations — much to the horror of kids’ health experts and the confusion of parents. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The sudden slashing of the pediatric vaccine schedule is just one of several new or expected changes to federal health policy that will affect the lives of millions of Americans, many of them kids. In addition to the hullabaloo over shots, the Trump administration also amplified its baseless war on Tylenol this week and introduced nutrition limits in the food-stamp program.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To make sense of all these changes, I asked my colleague <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/dylan-scott\">Dylan Scott</a> — occasional host of this newsletter and health care reporter extraordinaire — to run through the Trump administration’s new health policies and how they affect Americans. (Dylan is also on the brink of launching <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/good-medicine-newsletter-signup\">Good Medicine</a>, a new weekly newsletter for anyone trying to make sense of their health.)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are five major pillars to watch, he said.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">1) Pediatric vaccines</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On Monday, the CDC slashed its number of recommended, routine childhood vaccines from 17 to 11 — an unprecedented move that won’t exactly help America’s deep-seated issues with vaccine skepticism.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shots for measles, polio, chickenpox, diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough, among several other diseases, are still in. But the CDC now only recommends the meningitis, hepatitis A and B, and RSV vaccines to kids deemed “high-risk,” and it’s leaving the choice to vaccinate for flu, Covid-19, and rotavirus to individual parents and pediatricians.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The agency says its new guidance will not affect vaccine availability or insurance coverage — but it could very well sway many parents not to seek out some shots. That, in turn, <a href=\"https://www.statnews.com/2026/01/06/what-new-vaccine-schedule-means-doctors-parents-kids\">affects herd immunity for everyone</a>. In most of the US, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/interactive/2025/measles-vaccine-schools-outbreaks-public-health/?\">vaccination rates among kindergarteners</a> are already too low to prevent the spread of measles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">2) The war on Tylenol</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">President Donald Trump this week doubled down on his September denunciation of Tylenol, writing that pregnant women and young kids should not take the drug “for virtually any reason.” He and Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. have repeatedly suggested that Tylenol could cause autism — a claim that’s <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/390/bmj.r2025\">not supported by scientific evidence</a>. (<a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/poll-after-president-trumps-warning-many-people-are-uncertain-about-whether-tylenol-use-in-pregnancy-causes-autism-most-republicans-say-it-is-probably-or-definitely-true/\">More than half</a> of Republican voters believe it’s true, nonetheless.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s rhetoric is all part of what Dylan calls a larger “witch hunt to find a cause for autism,” which has already ensnared a range of suspects: chemicals, molds, childhood vaccines, “mysterious toxins.” But scientists already know that the marked increase in autism diagnoses relates to better screening methods and an expanded definition of the disorder. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/health/414740/rfk-jr-autism-kids-causes-diagnosis-meaning\">As Dylan wrote last year</a>, the quest to find some alternative, silver-bullet explanation just risks causing more confusion.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">3) Junk food bans</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Five states introduced <a href=\"https://www.fns.usda.gov/snap/waivers/foodrestriction\">new restrictions to their food-stamp programs</a> on January 1, banning participants from using their benefits to buy soda, candy, and other unhealthy foods and beverages. At least a dozen more are expected to introduce similar limitations later this year, including Florida, Virginia, and Texas.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">4) Dietary guidelines</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump administration is expected to release new dietary guidelines within a matter of days as part of a routine, scheduled update. (You may remember the “food pyramid” — in 2011, that became “MyPlate.”)&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The government’s guidance for healthy eating, which directly influences the meals served in schools, day cares and other public settings, has stayed fairly stable over time. But many nutrition experts expect this year’s update <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/06/well/eat/dietary-guidelines-overhaul-rfk-jr.html\">to veer</a> in a distinctly MAHA direction, perhaps by warning against ultra-processed foods or encouraging more red meat consumption. Avoiding ultra-processed foods could be beneficial, but Americans already have <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/386374/grocery-store-meat-purchasing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">plenty of meat</a> in their diets.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">5) Fluoride in drinking water</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Trump administration hasn’t taken concrete action on fluoridated water yet, it’s an area to watch: Several states and municipalities have <a href=\"https://www.multistate.us/insider/2025/5/27/states-move-to-ban-water-fluoridation-utah-and-florida-enacted-laws-in-2025\">already banned fluoridation</a> with Kennedy’s encouragement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For many of us, of course, this all raises some frightening questions, like: How <em>do</em> you navigate your personal health decisions in this environment? And if I can’t trust the CDC to tell me what shots to get my kid, who exactly should I trust?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I always tell people the best source to ask about your personal medical decisions is your doctor,” Dylan said. “Surveys consistently <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/health-information-trust/kff-tracking-poll-on-health-information-and-trust-january-2025/\">find</a> that is the person most people trust and that makes sense, they know you and your health better than anyone.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you don&#8217;t have a doctor, or if you’d like to do some Googling of your own before talking with them, Dylan recommends looking to authorities like your state government (some of which have <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/other-health/states-are-forming-health-alliances-can-they-make-a-difference-for-public-health-policy/\">banded together to give public health advice</a>), the relevant medical societies (like <a href=\"https://publications.aap.org/redbook/resources/15585/AAP-Immunization-Schedule?autologincheck=redirected\">the American Academy of Pediatrics</a> or <a href=\"https://www.acog.org/womens-health/infographics/vaccines-during-pregnancy\">the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a>) or <a href=\"https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/vaccine-integrity-project\">the Vaccine Integrity Project</a> run by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And average vehicle speeds improved by 23 percent. That’s the difference between a one-hour crawl and a 45-minute commute.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/90Eca-charge-for-traffic-get-less-traffic-1.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"Line chart showing daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s toll zone in 2025, which are lower than the expected numbers without tolls. \" title=\"Line chart showing daily vehicle entries into Manhattan’s toll zone in 2025, which are lower than the expected numbers without tolls. \" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the real gains came at the entry points. At the Holland Tunnel, for example, morning rush hour speeds jumped from 10.8 to 16.2 miles per hour — a 51 percent improvement. <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w33584/w33584.pdf\">A separate analysis</a> that used anonymized Google Maps data found these improvements spilled over to regional roads, meaning even drivers outside the zone got faster commutes.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Public transit riders benefited, too.</strong> After years of steady decline, average bus speeds in the zone ticked up 2.3 percent, reversing the trend seen in 2023 and 2024. Subway and bus ridership is up too, carrying more than 400,000 riders every day compared to 2024.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s easy to dismiss traffic as just a nuisance, but sitting in it is linked to higher stress, <a href=\"https://inrix.com/press-releases/2024-global-traffic-scorecard-us/\">lost productivity</a>, and <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4243514/\">worse air quality</a> for everyone. Getting people out of cars and onto transit helps on all three fronts.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Streets got safer.</strong> Crashes involving trucks in the zone dropped by 21 percent compared to the previous year.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>The MTA made money.</strong> Net revenue<strong> </strong>exceeded the MTA’s initial projections. That cash is earmarked for transit upgrades, including modern subway signals, 56 new elevators for accessibility, and the Second Avenue Subway extension.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>The one place the jury is still out is on air quality.</strong> It’s worth watching because air pollution is a quiet killer. In New York City alone, fine particulate matter contributes to <a href=\"https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/traffic-and-air-pollution/\">roughly 2,000 deaths and over 5,000 hospitalizations each year</a> — and traffic is a major source of those pollutants.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s44407-025-00037-2.epdf?sharing_token=DWfBS4Zn9K5BTU18tiWALtRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0PuX7QbH8GcqisbUCMAJiQZC5aTIN22vyd-PD9BlShTPfE-Rup2K0PwHAarL3_MmZU4kh4ZozO1jXnj5GMtfrru-uzO20_kkC7PrXMk-78WDFBqa-wqnJdHKRp6j1nMpn8%3D\">recent study</a> from Cornell found a 22 percent decline in one kind of particulate matter after congestion pricing went into effect, while <a href=\"https://www.cody-cook.com/papers/nyc_congestion_pricing.pdf\">another analysis</a> found little effect. The <a href=\"https://www.mta.info/document/195631\">MTA’s own analysis</a> showed no significant change in pollution levels. If <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/stories/2023/03/london-low-emissions-zone-pollution/\">London</a> and <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w24410/w24410.pdf\">Stockholm</a> are any guide, it’ll take a few years of data before congestion pricing’s effects on air quality becomes clear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s also the question of drivers who, looking to dodge the toll, might reroute through Queens or other neighborhoods outside the zone. The MTA has <a href=\"https://www.mta.info/project/cbdtp/mitigation\">anticipated that and earmarked $100 million</a> to offset potential air quality impacts in those neighborhoods: funding school air filters near highways and swapping out diesel equipment for electric.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The vocal opposition that greeted the program’s launch has largely died down, similar to what happened elsewhere. When Stockholm launched its congestion pricing in 2006, <a href=\"https://www.sfcta.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/Congestion%20Pricing%20Case%20Studies%20200213%20-%20Stockholm.pdf\">two-thirds of residents opposed it</a>. After a six-month pilot, they held a referendum. <a href=\"https://www.transportenvironment.org/articles/stockholm-votes-yes-congestion-charging\">More than half voted to keep it</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">New York seems to be on the same arc. Gov. Kathy Hochul, who delayed the program in 2024, now touts it as an “<a href=\"https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/less-traffic-better-transit-its-first-anniversary-governor-hochul-celebrates-transformational\">unprecedented success</a>.” And other cities are paying attention. Officials in Los Angeles have already reached out to New York for advice on their own potential pilot project, <a href=\"https://gothamist.com/news/a-year-later-blowback-over-nycs-congestion-pricing-tolls-has-died-down\">according to Gothamist</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Turns out, if you charge people to drive, fewer people drive. Who knew.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

This year marks the first time since 1994 that World Cup matches will be played in the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This year’s edition has also gotten attention for political reasons. The US role in hosting the tournament has been years in the making, and it’s closely tied to President Donald Trump and his unusually warm relationship with FIFA President Gianni Infantino.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Infantino has praised Trump lavishly, presenting him with gifts — including FIFA’s Peace Prize, a wholly made-up award that the FIFA president gave to Trump last November — and has reportedly visited the White House more than any other world leader during Trump’s second term.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Today, Explained </em>co-host Astead Herndon spoke with Adam Crafton, a senior reporter at The Athletic, who has closely covered FIFA and the growing relationship between the two men.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full episode, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140\">Pandora</a>, and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A\">Spotify</a>.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm?e=VMP4101192051\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How did the US, Canada, and Mexico even get these games in the first place?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The way it works is nations bid, and they bid quite a long way out. The process for this was around 2017. It was actually during Trump&#8217;s first presidency.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s interesting to look back on, because President Trump gets the opportunity to take credit for it. But actually, one of the motivating factors for [the US, Canada, and Mexico] joining forces was kind of this concern about whether America, the USA, could win a bid by itself, because this was coming off the back of, if you remember, the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/5/27/8665577/fifa-arrests-indictment\">FBI&#8217;s criminal investigations into FIFA</a> and the DOJs involvement.&nbsp;And there was this concern about whether FIFA membership would actually go for it, just an American bid. So [the US] joined forces with Canada and Mexico.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Also, just this feeling at the time of Trump saying some pretty disparaging things about other parts of the world. During the bidding process, I spoke to people part of that bid, and they would be going round saying to people things like, “Oh, you know, Trump doesn&#8217;t really mean what he&#8217;s saying,” or “Don&#8217;t worry, he won&#8217;t be the president by the time this comes around.” And yet, here we are. And Trump, I think Trump likes it, basically, because he can claim credit. He can say, “I was here when we won this. I brought this, and now I&#8217;m here to deliver this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>We have our two main characters here: President Trump and Gianni Infantino, president of FIFA. Can you tell me about their relationship and how it&#8217;s shaping the World Cup?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their relationship was born out of the bid. Infantino kind of got himself into the Oval Office a couple of times; that was how it started. But what actually happened was, whereas a lot of people obviously turned on Trump towards the end of his first presidency and certainly after January 6, Infantino didn&#8217;t. There was no point where Infantino publicly distanced himself from Trump. He stayed close. He went to Mar-a-Lago. He maintained that relationship. And I think Trump, whatever people think of him, he&#8217;s clearly someone who remembers those who are loyal to him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“Infantino has praised Trump lavishly…and has reportedly visited the White House more than any other world leader during Trump’s second term.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When Trump was then out of office, FIFA found it really difficult to penetrate the White House. There was no picture with Joe Biden in the Oval Office. There was no visit to the Oval Office for Infantino during that time. Then, when Trump wins power in November 2024, Infantino is immediately on the front foot — I mean, on Instagram every other day, praising Trump. He went to his pre-inauguration rally. And Trump would keep name-checking him at these events. It was pretty odd for those of us who have followed Infantino as a job, kind of this soccer bureaucrat, to all of a sudden see him basically being on first name terms with the US president.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Infantino’s been in the Oval Office more than any foreign state leader, for example. That&#8217;s extraordinary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Wait, say that again? He&#8217;s been in the Oval Office more than any other foreign state leader, any other kind of dignitary?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yeah, I mean, if you think of, at least, in public appearances, where you see those kind of joint Oval Office affairs, like the one that, for example, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/470169/zohran-mamdani-donald-trump-oval-office-meeting-nyc-queens\">Mamdani had with Trump in the Oval Office</a>. There&#8217;s been several of those with Trump and Infantino.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Can you explain the FIFA Peace Prize?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, at the FIFA World Cup draw, at the start of December, Donald Trump was presented with the inaugural FIFA Peace Prize.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">FIFA has never had a Peace Prize. Nobody has ever asked FIFA to do a peace prize, as far as we know. And the background of this is earlier, in Autumn 2025, there was a kind of unofficial campaign coming out of the White House to suggest that President Trump should be winning the Nobel Peace Prize. And actually, the day before the Nobel Peace Prize was announced, Infantino goes out on Instagram and <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/04/sport/soccer-world-cup-peace-prize-trump-intl\">actually says</a> President Trump deserves it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I mean, there&#8217;s no reason for the president of FIFA to be making these declarations about who deserves the Nobel Peace Prize. Why is Infantino going out on a limb in this way?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There&#8217;s a few theories on this. The first is, just: Infantino loves it, right? He loves being around rich, powerful people — sees himself as this kind of head of state for soccer.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The second view is there is a pragmatic need for FIFA to go above and beyondd. And maybe they just think, “This is what we need to do to make sure we get what we need.” And there are things that FIFA needs. So, the host cities, the 11 host cities in the states, <a href=\"https://www.grants.gov/search-results-detail/360832\">have needed $625 million</a> worth of federal security funding for the tournament.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Recently, and amid all the immigration policies that have been going on, FIFA secured what has been called a “<a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/sports/soccer/president-trump-unveils-fifa-pass-world-cup-rcna244499\">FIFA pass</a>,” which means that, if you have bought a ticket for the World Cup, you will get an appointment wherever you are in the world through a visa interview in your country within six to eight weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There are these concessions that FIFA have got, but at the same time, you now have four nations — Haiti, Iran, Senegal, Ivory Coast — whose countries have travel bans, which mean their fans can&#8217;t travel to the tournament.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, there&#8217;s some wins and there&#8217;s some losses, but I think FIFA are wary [that], at some point, someone in the White House might turn around, look at FIFA and say, “Hang on. They are a kind of a global organization that get tax breaks from America, that get all this revenue from putting on a tournament on our soil, and we are not getting a cut of the ticket revenue, of the parking revenue, of the broadcast, the sponsorship. Why are we helping these guys so much?” Does a Peace Prize go some way to just making sure that&#8217;s always on [Trump’s] desk and reminding him FIFA&#8217;s great?</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The question of whether transgender athletes have a right to play school-sponsored sports was always the toughest legal issue facing trans advocates.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Supreme Court’s trans rights precedents are <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/462981/supreme-court-new-term-ot-2026-democracy-tariffs-lgbtq\">particularly ill-suited</a> for plaintiffs challenging state laws prohibiting trans women from playing on women’s sports teams. The politics of this issue are <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/politics-news/poll-americans-oppose-trans-women-competing-female-sports-2-3-gen-z-rcna203658\">absolutely awful</a> for trans people. And the Court is dominated by Republicans who, just last June, voted that states could <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/scotus/417281/supreme-court-skremett-transgender-tennessee-health\">ban trans youth</a> from receiving gender-affirming medical care.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So it is likely that most of the justices will rule, in either <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/little-v-hecox/\"><em>Little v. Hecox</em></a> or <a href=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/cases/case-files/west-virginia-v-b-p-j-2-2/\"><em>West Virginia v. B.P.J.</em></a>, that states may prohibit trans women from playing women’s sports at the high school or college level. Both cases present this question to the justices — although there is a chance the Court will dismiss the <em>Hecox</em> case because the plaintiff in that case makes a strong argument that the case is now moot.</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>The question of whether trans women may play high school or college sports has always been the most difficult legal issue facing trans rights advocates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In <em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em>, the Supreme Court said a law banning “sex” discrimination in employment protects trans workers.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>But sex discrimination is allowed in sports — teams are typically gender-segregated — so <em>Bostock</em> doesn’t apply there.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To understand why trans advocates must climb such a steep hill to prevail in <em>Hecox</em> or <em>B.P.J.</em>, it’s helpful to be familiar with <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/19pdf/17-1618_hfci.pdf\"><em>Bostock v. Clayton County</em></a> (2020), the one major victory the Court has given transgender Americans. <em>Bostock</em> held that a federal law which bars employment discrimination “on the basis of sex” prevents workplace discrimination targeting LGBTQ employees.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although <em>Bostock</em> assumed that the word “sex” refers only to “biological distinctions between male and female” (that is, to sex assigned at birth), it concluded that “it is impossible to discriminate against a person for being homosexual or transgender without discriminating against that individual based on sex.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea is that if Herman is allowed to date Janet, but Juanita is not, then Juanita is being treated differently because of her sex. Similarly, if a cisgender male worker is allowed to wear stereotypically male clothes, to use a male name, and to otherwise present as a man, then an “employee who was identified as female at birth” must also be allowed to do so, or they are also being discriminated against because of their sex.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this rationale does not apply to sports, because the law permits sex-segregated sports teams. If a company attempted to divide its workers into male and female “teams,” that would be illegal. But schools may, and typically do, have separate sports teams for men and women.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To prevail in a case like <em>Hecox</em> or <em>B.P.J.</em>, in other words, trans plaintiffs must show that they are protected from discrimination because they are transgender — and not just because they are men or women. And, while the Supreme Court held <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/429/190/\">half-a-century ago</a> that ordinary sex discrimination by the government is typically forbidden by the Constitution, it has never ruled that transgender Americans are protected because they are trans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, several sitting justices appear to have already concluded that trans people do not enjoy constitutional protection. Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote an entire concurring opinion in <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-477_2cp3.pdf\"><em>United States v. Skremetti</em></a> (2025), the trans health care case, arguing that they do not. In an even more ominous sign for trans athletes, Justice Brett Kavanaugh worried during the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/2024/23-477_hgdj.pdf\"><em>Skremetti</em> oral argument</a> that, if trans women were given heightened constitutional protection, that could enable them “to play in women&#8217;s and girls&#8217; sports … notwithstanding the competitive fairness and safety issues that have been vocally raised by some female athletes.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realistically, in other words, trans athletes should expect a rough ride in the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">So what exactly are <em>Hecox </em>and <em>B.P.J.</em> about?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The plaintiffs’ specific claims in <em>Hecox</em> and <em>B.P.J.</em> are fairly modest. They don’t claim that all trans athletes should be allowed to play women’s sports, but rather only a certain subset whom, they argue, do not have a competitive advantage.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The plaintiff in <em>B.P.J.</em>, who is identified only by her initials because of her young age, is a high school track-and-field athlete. According to her brief, she “transitioned early in life” and “has <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-43/384127/20251110174312657_B.P.J.%20Respondent%20Brief%20Final.pdf\">received puberty-delaying medication</a> and gender-affirming estrogen,” and thus has never gone through male puberty. The plaintiff in <em>Hecox</em> is Lindsay Hecox, a former college athlete who “is treated with both testosterone suppression and estrogen” and who says she “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-38/384129/20251110175630987_Hecox%20Respondents%20Brief%20Final.pdf\">has circulating testosterone levels typical of cisgender women</a>.” (Hecox is also a college senior who does not currently play on any team and who says that she does not intend to play college sports in the future, which is why she argues her case is moot.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Neither plaintiff argues that <em>all</em> transgender women should be allowed to play high school or college sports. Instead, they seek a court order that applies to trans women with testosterone levels similar to cisgender women. Their lawyers argue that this subset of trans women enjoy “no athletic advantage” over cis women.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, the state of Idaho, the defendant in <em>Hecox</em>, spends a <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-38/374543/20250912154628466_Hecox%20Merits%20Opening%20Brief.pdf\">simply enormous amount of its brief</a> doubting this factual claim. They rely largely on statements by Gregory Brown, a professor of exercise science whose professional webpage identifies him as “<a href=\"https://www.unk.edu/academics/hperls/bio_pages/Gregory%20Brown.php\">the faculty advisor for Turning Point USA</a>” on his campus. The plaintiffs, meanwhile, rely largely on testimony by professor Joshua Safer, an endocrinologist who told the trial court that heard <em>Hecox</em> that “there is a medical consensus that the <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-38/384129/20251110175630987_Hecox%20Respondents%20Brief%20Final.pdf\">difference in testosterone</a> is generally the primary known driver of differences in athletic performance between elite male athletes and elite female athletes.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For what it is worth, one of the plaintiffs’ primary arguments before the Supreme Court is that the nation’s highest Court is the wrong forum to litigate this disagreement among professors. The trial courts in <em>Hecox</em> and <em>B.P.J.</em> deemed Safer’s testimony to be more credible than Brown’s. And appeals courts like the Supreme Court typically aren’t supposed to second-guess a trial court’s factual findings unless they are “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/clearly_erroneous\">clearly erroneous</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This Supreme Court, however, is unlikely to defer to the lower courts just because the <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_52\">rules of civil procedure instruct them to do so</a>. In <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/21-418_i425.pdf\"><em>Kennedy v. Bremerton School District</em> </a>(2022), a case about a public school football coach who incorporated prayer and other Christian activity into his coaching, the Court’s Republican majority <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2022/6/27/23184848/supreme-court-kennedy-bremerton-school-football-coach-prayer-neil-gorsuch\">made up a fake set of facts</a> to justify ruling in favor of that coach — and even adhered to these fake facts after Justice Sonia Sotomayor produced photographic evidence that her Republican justices weren’t telling the truth. In cases involving disagreements about medicine, Republican justices often argue that state legislatures have broad leeway to do what they want so long as “<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-380.ZO.html\">medical uncertainty</a>” exists.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And, even if the Supreme Court does credit the lower court’s finding that Safer has a more accurate understanding of how testosterone impacts athletic performance than Brown, the outcome of this battle of the professors only matters if the plaintiffs’ lawyers can convince a majority of the justices that trans people enjoy heightened protection under the Constitution.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Heightened scrutiny, briefly explained</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As a general rule, the government is allowed to discriminate. It can discriminate against unqualified applicants and in favor of highly qualified ones when deciding whom to hire. It can discriminate against rich people and in favor of poor people when deciding who receives welfare benefits. And it can discriminate against criminals and in favor of law-abiding people when deciding whom to incarcerate.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Virtually all laws draw some kind of distinction between people they do apply to and people who are unaffected. And the Constitution typically permits this kind of discrimination, even when there is scientific evidence that a particular law discriminates for unsound reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, there are some forms of discrimination that are ordinarily not allowed. Laws that discriminate on the basis of race, sex, or religion, for example, are subject to “heightened” scrutiny under the Constitution. The details of how this scrutiny works often depend on the type of discrimination — the Constitution treats race discrimination with more skepticism than sex discrimination, for example — but most laws that are subject to heightened scrutiny fail.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Supreme Court held in <a href=\"https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1428365285620704265&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr\"><em>United States v. Virginia</em></a> (1996), for example, that “a party seeking to uphold government action based on sex must establish an ‘exceedingly persuasive justification’ for the classification.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So how does the Court determine which forms of discrimination are allowed, and which ones are constitutionally suspect? Under the Court’s past decisions, the most important question is whether a particular group has historically been subject to discrimination that “<a href=\"https://caselaw.findlaw.com/court/us-supreme-court/473/432.html\">bears no relation to ability to perform or contribute to society</a>.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Court also sometimes looks at other factors, such as whether a group exhibits “<a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/477/635/\">obvious, immutable, or distinguishing characteristics</a> that define them as a discrete group” or whether the group is relatively politically powerless. But these factors are less important. Religious discrimination is constitutionally suspect, for example, even though people can change their religion. And women and people of color have not lost their constitutional protection even as they’ve gained political power relative to women and racial minorities in the past.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The lawyers representing the plaintiffs in <em>Hecox</em> and <em>B.P.J.</em> make a strong argument that discrimination on the basis of gender identity should be subject to heightened scrutiny. In their brief, they list several <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-38/384129/20251110175630987_Hecox%20Respondents%20Brief%20Final.pdf\">historical laws that targeted trans people</a>. Over two dozen US cities, including major metropolises like Chicago, used to ban “cross dressing,” for example. Others targeted bars that served “female impersonators.” At one point, the lawyers argue, the United States effectively barred openly trans people from immigrating.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, someone’s gender identity bears little relationship to their ability to contribute to society. As the plaintiffs’ lawyers write, “being transgender does not make someone less capable of being a lawyer, engineer, farmer, or doctor.” And openly trans people have historically held little political power. In all of American history, there’s been exactly one openly trans member of Congress — and she <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_McBride\">hasn’t even completed a single term in office</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Will that be enough for this Supreme Court? Probably not. As Barrett noted in her <em>Skrmetti</em> concurrence, the Court “<a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/23-477_2cp3.pdf\">has not recognized any new constitutionally protected classes in over four decades</a>.” The Court’s gay rights cases, for example, seemed to <a href=\"https://archive.thinkprogress.org/kennedy-was-a-bad-justice-76e464024d78/\">actively avoid the question</a> of whether discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation is suspect — even when those decisions found other reasons to rule in favor of gay plaintiffs. So a decision adding trans people to the pantheon of protected groups would be a highly unusual move by the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And, even if the Court does conclude that trans people enjoy this protection, the plaintiffs in <em>Hecox</em> and <em>B.P.J.</em> must still overcome an additional hurdle.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Courts sometimes uphold laws that are subject to heightened scrutiny</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let’s say that the lawyers representing Hecox and B.P.J. somehow convince a majority of these justices that discrimination against trans people is just as odious as discrimination against women, and thus that laws that discriminate on the basis of gender identity should be subject to heightened scrutiny. Most laws subject to this scrutiny fail, but not all laws do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As the Court held in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/518/515/\"><em>Virginia</em></a>, laws that discriminate on the basis of sex are permitted if they serve “important governmental objectives” and “the discriminatory means employed are substantially related to the achievement of those objectives.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Indeed, one example of a law that discriminates on the basis of sex, but that courts have allowed to remain in place, is a law that segregates men and women onto different high school or college sports teams. Because highly athletic men typically outperform highly athletic women in sports, women-only sports teams are necessary to ensure that women have the opportunity to play. If women-only teams did not exist, nearly all women would be excluded from high school and college sports, because they would be unable to compete with their male classmates.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or, to use the same language the Supreme Court used in <em>Virginia</em>, gender-segregated sports teams are allowed because they are substantially related to the important objective of allowing both men and women to play competitive sports.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Significantly, this rationale holds even though there are some women who can outperform nearly all men, and there are some men who underperform most women. A cisgender high school boy isn’t allowed to try out for the women’s field hockey team, even if he can demonstrate that he has unusually low testosterone levels.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The law, in other words, allows states to use the blunt instrument of declaring that all cisgender men must play on one team, and all cisgender women must play on another team, regardless of whether any particular man or woman’s athletic performance matches that of the other sex.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, even if Hecox and B.P.J. can convince the Court that trans women with low testosterone levels do not enjoy a competitive advantage over cisgender women, and even if they convince the Court that laws that discriminate against trans people are subject to heightened scrutiny, there is still one more hurdle that they must overcome. The law typically permits schools to segregate sports teams based on students’ sex assigned at birth, so why should a trans athlete be treated differently than a cis athlete with similar athletic ability?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hecox and B.P.J.’s lawyers, for what it is worth, have a pretty good answer to this question. They argue that “courts have recognized that sex separation in sports can pass constitutional muster where men and women <a href=\"https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/24/24-38/384129/20251110175630987_Hecox%20Respondents%20Brief%20Final.pdf\">still have equal opportunities to compete</a>.” Thus, the hypothetical cisgender boy with low testosterone does not face discrimination because he can still try out for the men’s team. But transgender women who experience gender dysphoria, a psychological condition where the inability to express their gender identity causes great distress, cannot try out for the men’s team without triggering that distress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That argument persuaded lower courts. As Hecox’s lawyers note in their brief, one court concluded that claiming that trans women can simply play men’s sports “is analogous to claiming [gay people] are not prevented from marrying under statutes preventing same-sex marriage because lesbians and gays could marry someone of a different sex” — an argument the Supreme Court rejected in its marriage equality decision in <a href=\"https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/576/644/\"><em>Obergefell v. Hodges</em></a> (2015).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But even if this argument persuaded lower courts, it’s far from clear that it will persuade the Supreme Court. Three current justices dissented in <em>Obergefell</em>. And two other current justices, Kavanaugh and Barrett, have signalled pretty clearly that they are unsympathetic to trans women who wish to play school sports. That’s five votes — a majority in the Supreme Court.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of which is a long way of saying that proponents of trans inclusion in school sports face a very difficult climb in the Supreme Court. Many of the Court’s current members have already indicated that they reject the pro-trans arguments in <em>Hecox</em> and <em>B.P.J.</em> And even if these plaintiffs faced a less hostile panel of justices, current legal doctrine is not very favorable to trans people, at least in areas where the Constitution typically permits the government to treat men differently than women.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

To commemorate the occasion, the White House launched a new page promising the “TRUTH” about “a date which will live in infamy.” Put simply, it’s bonkers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How does the White House describe January 6?</strong> The page, which prominently features a black-and-white image of former Speaker Nancy Pelosi looming over other members of Congress, claims that “it was the Democrats who staged the real insurrection” and describes the 2020 election as “stolen.” (They did not, and it was not.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It also claims, falsely, that no law enforcement officers lost their lives and suggests Capitol Police “escalate[d] tensions” with rioters. In reality, three officers who died in the days following the attack are considered to have died “in the line of duty.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The full list of distortions and false statements is too long to get into here, and it might be easier to list the things the page <em>does</em> get right. For example, the correct date, January 6, 2021, is in block letters at the top of the page.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> Trump and the Republican Party have both taken many swings at rewriting the narrative of January 6, but this is their most comprehensive effort to date. Notably, it’s not merely coming off the cuff in a Trump rally speech. This is a deliberate, taxpayer-funded attempt to rewrite history (and, <a href=\"https://x.com/StevenCheung47/status/2008622466227216457?s=20\">seemingly</a>, to troll Trump’s opponents).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the big picture?</strong> In many ways, Trump has already succeeded where it counts on January 6. He’s president again, and he has his party fully behind him on this issue. Marco Rubio, who was a senator on January 6 and described it as “<a href=\"https://x.com/marcorubio/status/1346909901478522880?s=20\">anti-American anarchy</a>,” is now his secretary of state. And while the attack still isn’t popular with voters writ large, it’s also <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/01/06/jan-6-american-attitudes-polling-trump/\">fading as an animating issue</a>. The White House page may be best viewed as a victory lap.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">And with that, it’s time to log off…</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Boy, that was a bleak one. Let’s end with one quick good thing and get off the internet. I really enjoyed <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/cover-story/cover-story-2026-01-12\">this week’s New Yorker cover</a>, which depicts a cat in a window as passersby trudge through winter weather outside. It’s the kind of small moment that always brightens my day when it happens in real life, too. Have a great evening, and we’ll see you back here tomorrow! </p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The case is known as <a href=\"https://documents.courts.state.wy.us/Opinions/S-24-0326%20State%20v.%20Johnson%20Final.pdf\"><em>State v. Johnson</em></a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Wyoming is America’s reddest state — President Donald Trump won Wyoming by 46 points in 2024, a <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/11/05/us/elections/results-president.html\">wider margin than in any other state</a> — so it is more than a little surprising that abortion is legal there. It turns out, moreover, that abortion is legal in Wyoming entirely because of a <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/23/23653183/abortion-wyoming-obamacare-barack-obama-supreme-court-johnson\">largely performative state constitutional amendment</a> enacted in 2012 to undercut the Affordable Care Act, the landmark health care legislation often referred to as Obamacare.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The legislative fight to enact Obamacare was one of the most contentious, and most partisan, congressional battles of the last several decades. Republican opponents of the law argued, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/2023/3/23/23653183/abortion-wyoming-obamacare-barack-obama-supreme-court-johnson\">often in hyperbolic terms</a>, that the Affordable Care Act amounted to a “government takeover of health care” that would strip many Americans of their ability to make health care decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the wake of these attacks on President Barack Obama’s signature legislative accomplishment, Wyoming was one of a few states that enacted state laws or constitutional amendments purporting to protect patient choice. Wyoming’s amendment provides that “<a href=\"https://documents.courts.state.wy.us/Opinions/S-24-0326%20State%20v.%20Johnson%20Final.pdf\">each competent adult shall have the right to make his or her own health care decisions</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These patient choice laws were almost entirely symbolic, at least to the extent that they sought to undercut Obamacare. The US Constitution provides that, when a state law is at odds with an act of Congress, <a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articlevi\">the federal law prevails</a>. So, even if Obamacare did restrict patient choice, and even if a state constitution forbids those restrictions, the federal Affordable Care Act supersedes any state law that conflicts with it.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, while Wyoming’s 2012 amendment did nothing to halt Obamacare, it is written in very broad terms and its language has clear implications for Wyoming state laws that seek to ban any medical procedure — including abortion. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Chief Justice Lynne Boomgaarden writes in <em>Johnson</em>, though the 2012 amendment “was put to the voters in response to the Affordable Care Act, with no discussion of abortion care,” that historical reality “does not change the fact that the plain language of the amendment the voters ratified <a href=\"https://documents.courts.state.wy.us/Opinions/S-24-0326%20State%20v.%20Johnson%20Final.pdf\">went beyond addressing concerns with the Affordable Care Act</a> and granted ‘[e]ach competent adult’ ‘the right to make his or her own health care decisions.’”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, so long as a patient seeking an abortion is an adult and is mentally competent to make health decisions, they have a right to terminate their pregnancy. (The 2012 amendment also provides that health decisions regarding minors or people who are not mentally competent shall be made by their “<a href=\"https://documents.courts.state.wy.us/Opinions/S-24-0326%20State%20v.%20Johnson%20Final.pdf\">parent, guardian or legal representative</a>,” and not by the state.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the upshot of the <em>Johnson </em>decision is that a symbolic effort to repudiate the Democratic Party’s signature health care initiative instead wound up sabotaging one of the Republican Party’s key health policies — a ban on abortion.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The <em>Johnson </em>decision may leave some room for the state legislature to enact a new abortion ban</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of this said, the state supreme court did not rule that Wyoming may never, under any circumstances whatsoever, enact any law that restricts abortion. Instead, the court held that state laws targeting abortion must survive “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/12/2/21726876/supreme-court-religious-liberty-revolutionary-roman-catholic-diocese-cuomo-amy-coney-barrett\">strict scrutiny</a>,” a test that courts often apply to laws that tread upon fundamental constitutional rights.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Strict scrutiny is typically the most skeptical test that a court can apply to a law that is allegedly unconstitutional. As Boomgaarden’s opinion explains, a law fails strict scrutiny unless it advances a “compelling interest” and it uses the “<a href=\"https://documents.courts.state.wy.us/Opinions/S-24-0326%20State%20v.%20Johnson%20Final.pdf\">least restrictive or onerous</a>” means to advance that interest.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although Boomgaarden assumes in her opinion that “protecting unborn life” is a sufficiently compelling goal, she points to several features of Wyoming’s anti-abortion law which place greater restrictions on patients seeking abortions than are necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One provision of the law, for example, permits physicians to perform abortions if “there is a substantial likelihood of death of the child within hours of the child’s birth,” but it does not permit an abortion if the baby would live slightly longer if born. As Boomgaarden writes, the evidence in <em>Johnson</em> showed that “physicians can know that certain anomalies are lethal, but they may not know whether a pregnancy will result in a live birth, and if so, whether it is substantially likely the child will die within hours or days.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Thus, she argues, the law needlessly prevents physicians from performing an abortion on “a fetus with an unquestionably fatal condition” if the doctor is not able to determine in advance the precise length of a very short life span. Such a law, <em>Johnson</em> concludes, “unduly restricts a woman’s right to obtain an abortion even when it will not serve the State’s interest in protecting unborn life.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Similarly, the state law permits an abortion when “necessary to preserve the woman from an imminent peril that substantially endangers her life or health.” But this exception applies only to patients with a “physical condition” that endangers their health, and not to patients with similarly dangerous mental conditions.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Boomgaarden writes, “it is obvious that, if a pregnant woman dies from a mental health condition,” perhaps because that condition results in suicide, then “the unborn child is very likely to die, too.” Thus, by not permitting women with life-threatening mental health conditions to obtain an abortion, the law places excessive restrictions on the right to an abortion that are not narrowly tailored to protect fetal life.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These are fairly narrow objections to the state’s abortion ban, however, so it is possible that the state legislature may enact a new law that prohibits most abortions but that provides broader exceptions — and then the constitutionality of this new law would have to be litigated all over again. Wyoming remains a very red state, so it is also possible that it will amend its constitution again to remove or limit the 2012 amendment protecting health care choice.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the moment, however, abortion remains legal in the state of Wyoming — all thanks to a failed attempt to spite President Barack Obama.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The famine in question was in Sudan. Soon after, I read another <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/22-08-2025-famine-confirmed-for-first-time-in-gaza\">headline</a>: “Famine confirmed for first time in Gaza.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As images of emaciated children spread across social media, the question loomed over Western onlookers: What can we do for starving kids halfway around the world?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>This story is part of the 2025 Future Perfect 25</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Every year, the Future Perfect team curates the undersung activists, organizers, and thinkers who are making the world a better place. This year’s honorees are all keeping progress on global health and development alive. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/468923/global-health-development-poverty-trump-usaid-future-perfect\">Read more about the project here</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many tried applying political pressure through advocacy, of course — but that didn’t work fast enough to prevent famine this year. There’s always donating to charity — but a lack of money is not the main driving force behind today’s famines. In the 21st century, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2024/2/1/24055829/gaza-israel-conflict-hunger-famine-starvation-sudan\">famine is a policy choice</a>. It largely happens because of conflict. It happens because fighting makes it too dangerous to get food to those who need it, or because the people in power block lifesaving aid from flowing across their borders.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That poses a moral problem for the average person: You see kids starving. You see the ways in which you seem powerless to prevent their starvation even after you’ve done whatever you can politically or financially. And yet, you somehow must act ethically in the face of that. How?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Inside this story</h2>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">• Famine has come roaring back this year, but the good news is that simple innovations are making it surprisingly cheap to fight hunger.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">• For $94, you can get a malnourished child access to a highly effective treatment program. For $1,500 to $4,500, you can save a child’s life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">• Organizations like <a href=\"https://taimaka.org/\">Taimaka</a>, <a href=\"https://alima.ngo/en/\">Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA),</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/impact-glance\">International Rescue Committee (IRC)</a> are great places to donate.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the spring, while reading a report about <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/406148/best-charities-mental-health-happiness-well-being\">highly effective charities</a>, I stumbled upon a nonprofit called <a href=\"https://taimaka.org/\">Taimaka</a>, which works on treating acute malnutrition in Nigeria. That country is not in the midst of famine, which is only declared when more than 30 percent of the population in an area is acutely malnourished, and when <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/article/what-famine-how-its-caused-and-how-stop-it\">a specific mortality threshold</a> is met.&nbsp;But in Nigeria, like in other countries across sub-Saharan Africa, there’s still a lot of hunger.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I went to Tamaika’s website and saw that it made an extraordinary claim: For just $94, I could get a severely malnourished kid access to its treatment program, which has been shown to help the vast majority of kids recover within weeks. That’s less than my partner and I had just spent on a single dinner from Uber Eats.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But what really shocked me was the cost of actually saving a life with Tamaika’s program, which is a little different. Since not every person who gets treated for malnutrition would have died otherwise, you’ve got to treat a bunch of people before you can assume you’ve actually saved one person’s life. In <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/23152657/poverty-cash-graduation-ultra-poor-brac\">my reporting</a> on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21728843/best-charities-donate-giving-tuesday\">effective philanthropy</a>, I was used to seeing programs —&nbsp;particularly <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">malaria programs</a>, which are among the most cost-effective — that said they could save a life for around $4,000. But Taimaka was claiming that with their hunger program, they could do it for just $1,500.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If that’s true, it would make this one of the cheapest ways to save somebody’s life. I wondered: Could I really prevent a kid from dying that easily? And if so, why wasn’t everyone doing it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How simple innovations made it cheap to fight hunger</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even though the world produces more than enough food to feed everyone, acute malnutrition remains the leading cause of childhood deaths globally, killing around <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/article/malnutrition-irc-helps-children-who-are-affected\">2 million children</a> every year. But the good news is that it’s extremely treatable. The main route to recovery is a little pouch of something known as RUTF (ready-to-use therapeutic food) —&nbsp;a vitamin-rich, peanut-based paste that can cure kids from being dangerously underweight in weeks. RUTF’s high nutritional value allows kids to gain weight more quickly than regular food, plus it’s easily digestible.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Sigal_PullQuotes-03.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, those pouches of food are expensive, and so is classic clinical treatment, which includes care at the hands of doctors and nurses. For example, in Nigeria, where Taimaka operates, that treatment has traditionally cost $251 per child — a lot of money in sub-Saharan Africa. The result is that more than <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/unicefdata/viz/JointMalnutritionEstimates2023Edition_16841450949590/WHO_re\">75 percent of malnourished kids</a> go untreated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So Tamaika, along with a couple of other innovative organizations like the <a href=\"https://alima.ngo/en/\">Alliance for International Medical Action (ALIMA)</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.rescue.org/impact-glance\">International Rescue Committee (IRC)</a>, are focused on tackling a big question: How can we bring that cost down so we can save more lives?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What we do differently is that we really have an eye towards, how can you do this as efficiently as possible?” Taimaka co-founder Justin Graham told me. “We had a cost-effectiveness model before we ever had a program.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Together with cofounder Abubakar Umar, a doctor with years of experience working in the hospital system in Nigeria, Graham decided to apply three innovations. The first is to rely mainly on community health workers, as opposed to doctors or nurses in hospitals. Community health workers have less specialized training, but that means they’re cheaper, and families don’t have to travel impossibly long distances to a hospital to access care.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The community-based care model has been growing increasingly popular in developing countries. It’s used <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23402638/mental-health-psychiatrist-shortage-community-care-africa\">in the mental health context</a>, too: Highly effective charities like <a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\">StrongMinds</a> and <a href=\"https://www.friendshipbench.org\">Friendship Bench</a> get lightly trained laypeople — picture someone like your grandmother, not your psychiatrist — to deliver brief therapy sessions in a home or a park. It’s also used to expand access to everything from <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-RHR-17.20\">family planning</a> to <a href=\"https://chwcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Task-Shifting-Global-Recommendations-and-Guidelines.pdf\">HIV services</a>. Empowering non-specialist providers or laypeople to take on tasks formerly done by specialists is what the World Health Organization refers to as “<a href=\"https://chwcentral.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Task-Shifting-Global-Recommendations-and-Guidelines.pdf\">task-shifting” or “task-sharing</a>.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The beauty of task-shifting is that it allows a program to scale up quickly and cheaply, while still delivering quality care. When workers encounter a complicated case that’s beyond their capacity, they refer the case to a nurse or doctor for care. When they can handle cases themselves, it frees up scarce expert health resources.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taimaka adopted this innovation —&nbsp;and then digitized it. The organization realized that when health workers record everything on paper, as is still common in sub-Saharan Africa, it’s highly time-intensive for staff. Plus, it doesn’t efficiently get feedback to higher management, so you end up needing more skilled managerial staff on the ground in each facility, which drives up costs. By providing health workers with a digital tool that helps them triage kids and record all the necessary data, Taimaka ensures quality of care at a lower cost —&nbsp;and quality of data that can then be used to inform research on the program.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finally, Taimaka reduced how much money it spends on therapeutic food by using <a href=\"https://www.devex.com/news/opinion-we-need-innovation-in-the-fight-against-child-malnutrition-103728\">recent evidence</a> from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) —&nbsp;the gold standard of medical evidence —&nbsp;run by ALIMA. That research found that children recover just as well if you taper their dose of therapeutic food over time; previously, the protocol had been to <em>increase</em> it over time in proportion to the child’s increasing weight, which the new research found is not necessary.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We looked around and saw, wow, there&#8217;s an RCT on this, and the WHO doesn&#8217;t want to move on it yet,” Graham told me, adding that that organization is slower to revise its protocols. “We were missing out on kids getting treated in the meantime. And so we asked, what is the bleeding-edge evidence that we can take and incorporate into our program, so we can validate it quickly and show that it works?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Turns out, it works beautifully: 80 percent of the children in Taimaka’s program fully recover. And by saving money on personnel and food, the program can afford to treat more kids in need. That is what allowed Taimaka to estimate that it could save a life for just $1,500. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Not everyone is so sure about that estimate, however, because of the <a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/taimaka-summary/\">quality of the evidence base</a>. <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, a nonprofit that evaluates and recommends the charities that save or improve lives the most per dollar, has some questions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Certainty is one of the criteria that we use for deciding on top charities,” Alice Redfern, GiveWell’s program officer specializing in nutrition, told me. And when evaluating a malnutrition program, it’s just really hard to gather the kind of causal data that would provide certainty about how many lives the program is saving that wouldn’t have been saved otherwise. You can’t show up to a malnourished population and say, “We’re going to treat half your children and let the other half starve, so that we can gather really good causal data on the treatment effects of our program.” That would obviously be unethical.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Sigal_PullQuotes-04.png?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"\" title=\"\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"\" data-portal-copyright=\"\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Other <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/community-based-management-acute-malnutrition\">questions</a> dog malnutrition programs, too. For example: When a program treats children and then sends them home cured, what percentage of those children end up returning to treatment again later that year? Taimaka thinks it’s only 5 to 7 percent. (Even if an area suffers from chronic food insecurity, kids there won’t always progress to severe malnutrition; oftentimes, a child will only go from mild to severe malnutrition if they contract an infectious disease that worsens their condition.) But GiveWell suspects the relapse rate may be higher. That leads GiveWell to think it’s too optimistic to suppose the program is really saving a life for $1,500. So Taimaka has revised its estimate; its website now says it can save a life for $1,500 to $4,500, indicating that some uncertainty remains.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that doesn’t mean Taimaka isn’t effective. “Even with that, we still think it’s a pretty good bet,” Redfern said. <a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/taimaka\">Other charity evaluators agree</a>. Although GiveWell does not yet rank Taimaka among its <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>, it was impressed enough to give Taimaka a grant last year to expand its programming. (Graham says that in five years, he hopes to be treating more than 100,000 patients annually.) One of the reasons GiveWell is excited to partner with the program is that they believe that, together, they can learn a lot about how to treat hunger cost-effectively, and use those learnings elsewhere.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Taimaka is really laser-focused on trying to treat as many children with as few resources as possible and maintaining really high-quality programming at the same time,” Redfern said. “And I think that also because of that, they&#8217;re very focused on learning and iterating.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>“The most neglected child is the malnourished child who’s not living in a CNN emergency”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Picture two types of funding with different purposes: humanitarian aid and development aid. Humanitarian aid responds to acute emergencies — like wars that precipitate famine — providing immediate, life-saving help. Development aid supports efforts to reduce poverty and build resilience in low-income countries that face chronic challenges like food insecurity.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hunger can stalk children in both scenarios. And if you’re a kid suffering from acute malnutrition, it doesn’t matter to you whether you’re in a humanitarian context or a development context. You’re just hungry. You just need help.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, malnourished kids in the development context too often go ignored.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The most neglected child is the malnourished child who&#8217;s not living in a CNN emergency,” Susan Shepherd, a pediatrician with ALIMA, told me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And when it comes to development aid, Graham said, “what really appeals to people oftentimes is preventative things.” Funders are often excited to fund a vaccine program that prevents a disease, say, because&nbsp;it’s a one-and-done fix that averts the need for later treatment. As the old saying goes, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this preference for prevention over treatment can mean that malnutrition gets sidelined, because malnutrition is not straightforward to prevent. That’s because it’s not one problem, like a disease caused by a single virus —&nbsp;it’s a devilish set of interrelated problems. For one thing, it exists in a bidirectional relationship with infectious disease: poor nutrition can make people more vulnerable to disease, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Imagine a kid who’s food insecure. He’s not getting proper nutrients, so he has a weaker immune system. One day, he gets diarrhea from unclean drinking water. Now that he’s sick, it’s much harder for his body to retain nutrients. He gets weaker, to the point that he can’t recover without help. But he’s unable to access treatment —&nbsp;either it’s too expensive, or the facility is too far away, or the road infrastructure is lacking, or there’s a security problem…</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Until you solve all of these problems, malnutrition will keep happening,” Graham said. “And solving all these problems means making Africa a developed continent. That’s a 10-, 20-, 30-year target, if not longer.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, one kid dies of acute malnutrition every 15 seconds.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“So, are we going to let millions of children die in the next 10 years, before we solve this problem?” Graham continued. “That is unacceptable to me.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Dr. Joseph-Désiré Yuma Ilale, who works for ALIMA from Abuja, Nigeria, agrees. He emphasized that if we neglect to treat malnourished kids, we’re damning their future and their country’s future, because those who survive still suffer from setbacks to their <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23484464/\">neurodevelopment</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It has been shown that the cognitive development of children who are undergoing several episodes of malnutrition might not be the same as other children who are not having malnutrition,” he said. That, in turn, could lower their <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9500247/\">academic performance</a> and lifelong earning potential. So, he suggested, we could consider malnutrition treatment itself a kind of prevention.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Investing in community-based management of malnutrition is not really a charity,” Yuma Ilale told me. “It&#8217;s an important investment in life.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, treating malnourished children in a country like Nigeria is no replacement for treating children in famine-stricken humanitarian contexts. Every child is irreplaceably precious. Every life lost is a tragedy. And there are so many lives that we have not been able to save this year.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, there are many children in the world we definitely <em>can </em>help right now, and yet are neglecting to help because we don’t realize that there is still so much more we can do.&nbsp;These are the&nbsp;children living outside the headlines, living through the quiet emergencies, whom we can save with astonishing ease.&nbsp; </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong><em>Update, January 6, 2026</em>, <em>12:20 pm ET</em>:</strong><em> This story was originally published on November 19 and has been updated to reflect Taimaka’s most recent recovery rate (80 percent), and to clarify Taimaka’s estimate of what percentage of children end up returning to treatment again within one year.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But the goals of all that focus are not quite as clear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the sweep of US history in Latin America, interventions like the capture of Maduro aren’t particularly unusual. It was the last 35 years since the end of the Cold War, when the US mostly refrained from these kinds of actions, that were the anomaly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Countries including Colombia, Cuba, and Mexico now have to take seriously whether America’s new interventionism will target them next. For now, there’s not much they can do to push back–but the long-term consequences are less clear.</p>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump administration is taking a shockingly interventionist approach to the Western Hemisphere, as shown by last weekend’s capture of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/us/politics/trump-cuba-greenland-colombia.html\">threats of military intervention </a>against several other countries in the region. But we can’t say we weren’t warned.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Donald Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/398910/why-trump-is-obsessed-with-latin-america-a-monroe-2-0-foreign-policy-could-back-fire-for-america\">came into office a second time pledging</a> to retake the Panama Canal and annex Greenland and possibly Canada. He&nbsp;renamed the Gulf of Mexico the “Gulf of America.” Less than a month into his term, he was slapping tariffs on Canada, Mexico, and Colombia for their perceived defiance of his agenda. His choice for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, had such longstanding interests in Latin American affairs that many observers saw him as effectively <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/news-columns-blogs/andres-oppenheimer/article164065057.html\">running US policy toward the region</a> from his Senate office during Trump’s first term.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s short-lived national security adviser, Mike Waltz (now ambassador to the UN), had dubbed the White House’s regional approach “<a href=\"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2025/01/09/trump_national_security_advisor_mike_waltz_on_greenland_panama_canal_call_it_monroe_doctrine_20.html\">Monroe Doctrine 2.0</a>.” Trump lately appears to prefer the <a href=\"https://view.newsletters.cnn.com/messages/17676265366030dedae93184a/raw\">New York Post-coined “Donroe Doctrine.”</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Trump’s view, his predecessors had let the doctrine, which originally stated that foreign powers should avoid meddling in the Western Hemisphere but evolved into a view that the US should be the preeminent power in the region, dangerously lapse. “The Monroe Doctrine is a big deal, but we’ve superseded it by a lot, by a real lot,” he said on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whatever you call it, it’s clear that the region is no longer the “<a href=\"https://foreignpolicy.com/2009/10/16/the-lost-continent/\">lost continent</a>” of US foreign policy. Whatever else the Maduro operation was, it made clear that all the language in Trump’s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/471443/trump-national-security-strategy-europe\">recently released national security strategy</a> about restoring “American preeminence in the Western Hemisphere” after “years of neglect” wasn’t just bluster.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s less clear is the purpose of the new attention focused on the region. What is the US actually trying to get out of Latin America, and are the region’s governments going to provide it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>US interventionism in Latin America is not new</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For all the talk in the past few days about how a Rubicon has been crossed in the use of force and the violation of international norms, the use of military force or covert action to depose a government in Latin America or the Caribbean is far from unprecedented.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Between the US invasion of Cuba in 1898 during the Spanish-American War and <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1993-2000/haiti#:~:text=The%20invasion%20force%20numbered%20nearly,mandate.\">Bill Clinton’s military intervention in Haiti in 1994</a>, there were roughly 17 instances of <a href=\"https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/united-states-interventions/\">successful direct US-backed regime change</a> in the region —&nbsp;and far more cases where indirect US pressure may have played a role in bringing down a government.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“In the broad sweep of history, it&#8217;s amazing how unexceptional this is,” Brian Winter, Latin American politics analyst and editor of Americas Quarterly magazine, told Vox. “The exceptional period was the last 35 years” following the end of the Cold War.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Winter added that “this White House is more focused on Latin America than any other since probably the 1960s,” referring to the era that followed Fidel Castro’s Cuban revolution, and included a number of military interventions meant to <a href=\"https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB513/\">prevent the spread of Communism</a> in the region as well as a confrontation with the Soviet Union over Cuba that brought the world to the brink of nuclear war.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But US interventionism in the region was relatively common up through the 1980s and early 1990s. As many have noted, Maduro’s capture <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473953/trump-maduro-regime-change\">took place on the 36th anniversary</a> of the arrest of Panama’s Manuel Noriega, another dictator indicted in US courts for drug trafficking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The administration has explicitly harkened back to this history with its invocations of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/398910/why-trump-is-obsessed-with-latin-america-a-monroe-2-0-foreign-policy-could-back-fire-for-america\">the Monroe Doctrine</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In particular, Trump’s assertion of a “Trump corollary” to the doctrine links his policy to the <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1899-1913/roosevelt-and-monroe-doctrine#:~:text=The%20Roosevelt%20Corollary%20of%20December,to%20the%20detriment%20of%20the\">1904 Roosevelt Corollary</a>, which asserted that the US would use military force as a last resort in “flagrant cases of…wrongdoing or impotence” by regional governments —&nbsp;an approach that became known as “gunboat diplomacy.” &nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If there’s a difference between the most recent case of US regime change and the previous era, it may be the lack of clarity in American motives. The US has intervened in the past to prevent foreign meddling (European imperialism in an earlier era, Communism later on), to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/27/us-honduras-coup\">protect US economic interests</a>, or to remove a suspected drug trafficker.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The justification for the Venezuela operation was a shifting mix of the three. For months, starting in December, as the US targeted suspected drug boats in the Caribbean, the administration’s messaging focused on Maduro’s role as an alleged “narcoterrorist” and cartel boss.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Months into the campaign, Trump and his aides began focusing on Venezuela’s past nationalization of American oil interests and the president is now heavily focused on retaking Venezuela’s oil resources for American companies.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the operation, US officials have made much of the 32 <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/cuba-us-venezuela-maduro-e66899b41f0b84cf83f77a69d399b486\">Cuban security personnel guarding Maduro</a> who were killed as well as <a href=\"https://www.foxnews.com/world/rubio-vows-eliminate-hezbollah-iran-operations-from-venezuela-after-maduro-capture\">dismantling Iranian and Hezbollah networks in the country</a>. It’s also interesting that Maduro’s capture came just hours <a href=\"https://x.com/RyanBergPhD/status/2007460356889731490\">after a meeting with Chinese diplomats</a>. Foreign meddling wasn’t a major feature of the administration’s rhetoric in the months leading up to the event, however. Trump doesn’t appear particularly interested in restoring democracy to Venezuela, though the country’s democratic <a href=\"https://link.defenseone.com/click/43362099.38139/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnl0aW1lcy5jb20vbGl2ZS8yMDI2LzAxLzA0L3dvcmxkL3RydW1wLXVzLXZlbmV6dWVsYS1tYWR1cm8vZWRtdW5kby1nb256YWxlei1yZWdhcmRlZC1hcy10aGUtd2lubmVyLW9mLXRoZS0yMDI0LXZvdGUtc2F5cy1oZS1pcy1wcmVzaWRlbnQtb2YtdmVuZXp1ZWxhP3NtaWQ9dXJsLXNoYXJlJm9yZWY9ZF9icmllZl9ubA/6682de6bb87a2b4bd104e37bBf979edc9\">opposition are nonetheless hopeful</a> this will work out in their favor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the end, different high-ranking Trump officials may have been interested in Venezuela for different reasons&nbsp;—crime, migration, energy, foreign influence — and put together a strong enough case for Trump. Calling it emblematic of a “doctrine” is probably generous.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">A one-man Cold War</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump repeatedly stated the day after Maduro was captured that the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473953/trump-maduro-regime-change\">US would be “running” Venezuela</a>, though the reality appears to be that the country’s government will be left in place–minus Maduro–so long as it meets the administration’s as-yet unspecified demands.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given the US’s actions over the past year, citizens of other Latin American countries could be forgiven for wondering if this definition of “running” applies to their countries as well. Trump has endorsed favored candidates in elections in <a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/argentina-election-results-javier-milei-trump-backed-party-wins/\">Argentina</a> and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/471003/trump-honduras-hernandez-asfura-nasralla\">Honduras</a> this year, and threatened tariffs against Brazil in order to stop the prosecution of his ally, Jair Bolsonaro.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More is likely to come in 2026 with presidential elections being held in Brazil and Colombia. At this point, it would be surprising if we <em>don’t </em>see Truth Social messages endorsing a preferred candidate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Colombia’s left-wing president, Gustavo Petro, has been a particular foil for Trump since the beginning of last year. In recent days, he has said that Petro —&nbsp;the leading regional critic of the Venezuela intervention — should “watch his ass” and called him a “sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States.” (Colombia is a major producer of cocaine but there’s little evidence linking Petro to the trade.) Unlike Venezuela, which has been a thorn in the side of US administrations for years, Colombia is one of America’s closest security partners in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If Colombian voters choose a Washington allied candidate, someone more on the right, the bilateral relationship might return to its normal state,” said Beth Dickinson, a Colombia-based analyst with the International Crisis Group. “But I do really worry about what could happen if a left-leaning candidate is elected.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s precedent for this kind of meddling as well. President Woodrow Wilson famously quipped that he would “<a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/media/documents/event/wilsons_forays_into_mexico.pdf\">teach the South American republics to elect good men</a>” and his successors intervened in overt and covert ways <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/07388942241279969\">dozens of times</a> in the region’s elections in the subsequent decades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Trump’s case, the meddling often seems less motivated by ideology commitment (Trump has gotten along quite well with the Communist leaders of China and North Korea) than personal animus. “Petro and Trump have found one another to be useful political enemies,” Dickinson noted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the case of Honduras, it appears to have been a concerted lobbying campaign by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/471003/trump-honduras-hernandez-asfura-nasralla\">Trump allies on behalf of the country’s imprisoned ex-president</a> rather than ideological affinity that prompted his interest in the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Likewise, Trump has chosen not to get behind Venezuela’s democratic opposition in the wake of Maduro’s ouster, but to work with his vice president, a committed if more pragmatic Chavista who seems willing to work toward better relations while continuing to publicly decry Yankee imperialism. (One major outstanding question of the past week is the degree of support the US may have had from elements of the Venezuelan regime in arranging for Maduro’s extraction.) As much as anything else, it was reportedly Maduro’s public displays of defiance and disrespect —&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/world/americas/trump-venezuela-leader-rodriguez-machado.html\">notably his televised dancing</a> —&nbsp;that pushed the administration to make the final decision to capture him.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The personal factor also seems to be paramount when it comes to Mexico’s Claudia Sheinbaum, on paper exactly the sort of lifelong committed leftist Trump should despise, who appears to have been able to keep him relatively satisfied over the past year with limited “wins” on fentanyl and border security and the <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2025/08/07/trump-sheinbaum-mexico-relationship-trade-00496002\">two seem to have a friendly rapport</a>. (Trump had a <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2020/07/07/mexico-president-andres-manuel-lopez-obrador-friends-trump-350974\">similarly friendly relationship with Sheinbaum’s predecessor</a> and mentor Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who had literally written an entire book attacking the US president.)&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether that will continue now that Trump appears to be gaining a taste for military action is not clear. In the past week, Trump has resurrected an idea —&nbsp;discussed by him and allies in Congress since his first term&nbsp;—&nbsp;of taking military action against drug cartels on Mexican soil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Is a unilateral use of force on Mexican soil probable? No,” said former Mexican ambassador to the United States Arturo Sarukhán. “Is it possible? Absolutely, and given what has just happened in Venezuela, I think the Mexican government should really take this very seriously.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The stakes of Sheinbaum’s ability to manage the Trump relationship couldn’t be higher heading into a pivotal year in the relationship which will include a <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/usmca-review-2026\">renegotiation of the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Taking a pragmatic approach to managing Trump may be harder for the other country currently in the US crosshairs: Cuba. Even at the worst of times, there was always a degree of pragmatism built into the US-Venezuela relationship: US firm <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/05/business/energy-environment/venezuela-chevron-trump-oil.html\">Chevron continued to pump oil</a> in the country, for instance. That gave at least an <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-maduro-envoy-migrants-grenell-edfa58920c0a76f0bbe9de995a07d1a3\">opening for negotiations</a> between the two countries early in the Trump administration and may yet allow the relationship to get back on track now that the dancing boogeyman is gone. That king of accommodation is much harder to imagine from the far more ideological Cuban regime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The hope in Washington is that the loss of its ally and the ongoing embargo on sanctioned oil shipments will cause the sclerotic and economically distressed Cuban regime to collapse on its own. And yet this is a regime that has defied predictions of its imminent demise for more than 60 years. If it doesn’t fall, could it be the next target for military intervention?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“These folks could look at Cuba and say, ‘well, compared to Venezuela, which is a country of 30 million people, Cuba is easy. We can put boots on the ground,” said Michael Bustamante, a professor of Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the University of Miami. “On the other hand, Cuba doesn&#8217;t have the largest oil reserves in the world, so is it worth the risk?”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Careful what you wish for</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s always a risk when it comes to Trump’s foreign policy of retroactively trying to map a coherent worldview onto a set of seemingly impulsive and often contradictory actions. But in the case of Latin America, the foreign policy is tied to the Trump team’s much more consistent domestic priorities: crime and migration.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The view is that by neglecting the region, previous administrations have allowed crises to develop which have driven illegal drugs and migrants into the United States. This is not necessarily a view unique to this administration. The Biden administration also made a much maligned effort to address the “<a href=\"https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Root-Causes-Strategy.pdf\">root causes</a>” of migration, albeit with much different methods. The administration is also interested in countering Chinese, Iranian and to a lesser extent Russian influence (that’s what the Trump corollary actually discusses) and combating leftism.&nbsp; These are not historically unusual goals.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Whether the Trump strategy will actually <em>accomplish </em>any of this is another story. Maduro may have had a hand in the cocaine trade but deposing him isn’t going to stop the opioids that have devastated American communities. Migration numbers are down at the US-Mexico border now, but a full-scale collapse in Venezuela could lead to a new uptick. Perhaps governments will be dissuaded from deepening their ties with China, perhaps faced with an unpredictable America, they will look to hedge with security and economic partnership elsewhere. (Even Trump’s closest South American ally, Javier Millei, is not above <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2025/09/24/trump-milei-us-argentina\">selling soybeans to the communists</a>.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then there are the unintended consequences. &#8220;There&#8217;s some level of ‘we&#8217;re big and bad and flexing our muscles’ [in the Trump policy.],” said James Saenz, former deputy assistant secretary of defense for counternarcotics in the Biden administration. “But in the past, we&#8217;ve chosen not to do these things for the long-term considerations of developing friends and allies around the world, because it provides for our security and our own economic opportunities.&#8221; The past year has already seen several European countries <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/468409/uk-intelligence-trump-caribbean-patel\">cut off the sharing of intelligence with the US </a>that they believed could be used in illegal strikes against civilian boats.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The international response to Maduro’s ouster has been somewhat muted and divided so far —&nbsp;very few, even on the Latin American left, are sorry to see him gone. Actions in Colombia, Mexico, or for that matter <a href=\"https://voxmedia.slack.com/archives/C02A97FPW/p1767662905764299\">Greenland</a> could have more profound consequences for US alliances.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As for the political consequences in Latin America itself, at the moment, the region appears in an <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/south-america/revolution-right-brian-winter\">overall rightward political drift</a> after recent elections in countries like Ecuador, Argentina, and Bolivia, which Maduro’s disastrous rule can take at least some credit for. The current generation of regional leaders won’t necessarily always look to do Trump’s bidding, but they may not be eager to defy him either. The longer term consequences are more unpredictable, but again, history can provide some guidance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“You can draw a direct line between, you know, Teddy Roosevelt&#8217;s use of the ‘big stick’ and the rise of Latin American nationalism, which eventually gave us figures like Fidel Castro,” Winter said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of which is to say that future US presidents are likely to have to reckon with the legacy of the Donroe Doctrine.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, January 6, 3 pm</strong> <strong>ET</strong>: A previous version of this story misstated the year of the Spanish-American War.

And he also warned Iran’s authoritarian regime that, if it starts killing the protesters who’ve recently amassed in its streets, “they’re going to get hit very hard by the United States.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, Trump <em>says</em> a lot of things. If his words were a perfect guide to US policy, America would currently be <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trumps-proposal-to-take-over-gaza-would-put-americans-at-risk-of-prosecution/\">governing the Gaza Strip</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Therefore, until this weekend, it seemed safe to assume that the president’s most outlandish military threats were mere bluster. Now that he has greenlit the overthrow of a foreign leader, who had ordered no attack against the United States, it is hard to be so sure.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, there is one big reason to think that, in military terms, Trump’s bark still exceeds his bite.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why Trump’s military interventions could get bolder</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Before turning to the causes for doubts about America storming the beaches of Greenland, it’s worth noting why the world is suddenly taking such scenarios seriously.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the beginning of his first term, Trump’s acts of war have grown steadily more audacious. In 2020, he ordered the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/13/21063527/trump-iran-soleimani-kill-wapo-nbc-news\">assasination of Iran’s top military official</a>; in April, he ordered <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/417460/iran-attack-trump-war\">large-scale air strikes</a> against that nation’s nuclear facilities; now, he has <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473953/trump-maduro-regime-change\">deposed Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro</a>, a sitting head of state, killing at least <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-venezuela.html\">80 people in the process</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In each of these cases, Trump ignored warnings that his actions could sow chaos and instability — if not <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/18/middleeast/us-iran-pandoras-box-intl\">all-out war</a>. And in every instance, the intervention’s <em>immediate</em> costs to the United States appeared lower than skeptics had predicted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It is clear that this pattern of events has emboldened Trump. In an interview with Fox News on Sunday night, he <a href=\"https://x.com/onestpress/status/2007659963280454088\">hailed</a> his own operation in Venezuela as “incredible” and said that “we have to do it again. We can do it again, too. Nobody can stop us.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given Trump’s words and deeds, the world should prepare for the US to deploy military force more frequently — and perhaps, ambitiously — in the coming years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Certainly, the president has shown that neither <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2026/01/04/trump-venezuela-legal-fallout-column-00710331\">international nor constitutional law</a> constrains his martial ambitions. And he insists that America has a right to “<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473986/maduro-venezuela-invasion-war-trump-oil\">dominate</a>” the Western Hemisphere and seize the resource wealth of weaker nations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The line that Trump still hasn’t crossed</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, Trump still appears bound by the primary constraint on American war-making since the invasion of Iraq: the US public’s low tolerance for American casualties.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has yet to order a novel military operation with a substantial American death toll. No US troops died in the course of assassinating Iran’s Maj. Gen. Qasem Soleimani or bombing its nuclear sites, nor did any Americans perish in the raid on Maduro’s palace.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the desire to avoid US casualties appeared to structure American policy in all of these cases. Iran responded to both the killing of Soleimani and bombing of its nuclear facilities by <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/u-s-base-iraq-comes-under-attack-missiles-iran-claims-n1112171\">firing ballistic</a> <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjxdgjpd48o\">missiles</a> at American airbases in the Middle East. When these failed to kill any US soldiers, Trump declined to return fire, evidently to avoid further escalation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Venezuela, meanwhile, the US has evidently decided to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/world/americas/delcy-rodriguez-venezuela.html\">leave Maduro’s party in power,</a> rather than hazard the sustained military occupation necessary to displace that authoritarian regime.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such restraint is politically wise. Even in the absence of American bloodshed, public support for Trump’s operation in Venezuela remains tepid, with <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/only-33-americans-approve-us-strike-venezuela-reutersipsos-poll-finds-2026-01-05/\">just 33 percent of voters</a> approving of the strike in a Reuters/Ipsos poll. The typical American does not perceive any compelling national interest in Venezuela being governed <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/world/venezuela/delcy-rodriguez-venezuelas-interim-leader-capture-nicolas-maduro-rcna252322\">by one leftist dictator</a> they’ve never heard of rather than some other one. Had any US troops died in Caracas, political opposition to Trump’s adventurism would surely be orders of magnitude more intense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The American public’s aversion to US military deaths can be seen in the trajectory of Joe Biden’s presidency. Although inflation corroded Biden’s popularity, his approval initially collapsed amid America’s bloody withdrawal from Afghanistan, which <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/08/29/1032044382/what-we-know-about-the-13-u-s-service-members-killed-in-the-kabul-attack\">claimed the lives of 13 American servicemembers</a>. Trump is well aware of the damage that this did to Biden; the Republican attended an <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-appears-at-arlington-cemetery-event-honoring-13-service-members-killed-in-kabul-bombing\">anniversary memorial</a> for those fallen soldiers in the heat of the 2024 campaign.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The backlash to American deaths from an invasion of Greenland or Colombia would likely be even more intense. After all, voters had <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/23/politics/polls-afghanistan-biden\">actually supported</a> withdrawing US troops from Afghanistan before it happened. By contrast, few Americans <a href=\"https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/52879-few-americans-want-to-take-over-greenland-most-oppose-covert-operations-military-action-poll\">want to buy Greenland</a>, let alone conquer it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Trump could still get a lot of Americans killed</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, there is still no guarantee that Trump will steer clear of a major war. It is impossible for even the most judicious leaders to perfectly anticipate the consequences of their military operations; conflicts can escalate. And Trump is not known for rigorously thinking through all of his policy decisions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moreover, even if Trump is unwilling to shed much American blood in service of his imperial fantasies, he could still reap a lot of death and chaos. Given our nation’s drone fleet and aerial might, Trump need not sacrifice many US soldiers to destabilize entire countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet, there are limits on what even a great power can achieve militarily without forfeiting its soldiers in large numbers. America probably can’t conquer Greenland — or cause genuine regime change throughout South America — without accepting a great many flag-draped coffins. And Trump still has not indicated that this is something he’s prepared to do.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

People split up and chose who they wanted to stay friends with, Finch said, “and I was not the chosen friend.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The whole experience sent Finch into “hermit mode,” where he began intensely analyzing his friendships and their patterns. He realized certain tendencies: He struggled to prioritize friendships the same way he prioritized romantic prospects, he was a people pleaser who felt he always had to earn people’s kindness, and he often sought friendships with people who were not emotionally available to him. And he would feel nervous when people were kind to him right off the bat — “It didn&#8217;t feel earned, and I didn&#8217;t feel like I deserved it.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Realizing his patterns, Finch was determined to break them. He wanted to start intentionally cultivating friendships with the people who were kind, whose interactions left him feeling safe and nourished. He started by making a list of everyone in his orbit, from current friends to old friends, coworkers, and acquaintances. Then, in his phone contacts, “I challenged myself to put a strawberry emoji next to the people who were really kind to me,” he said. “The kind of warmth and kindness that made me nervous.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This handful of “strawberry people” became Finch’s priority friends, and he even told some of them about his intentions to cultivate their friendship. He also put seedling emojis next to the names of people who challenged his ways of thinking and helped him grow.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It completely changed my life,” said Finch. Clearly marking where he would channel his energy gave him a roadmap to building more purposeful relationships. Previously, he would get easily overwhelmed by text messages, opting to respond to no one. But now, if a text from a strawberry person popped up on this phone, the emoji acted as a reminder to Finch that he values this friendship and should try to respond without too much delay, even if he was tired.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The practice also made Finch more mindful about how interactions with others really made him feel. After hanging out, he made a practice of asking himself “how did that feel?” or “how did that feel in my body?” He noticed times when he was tense versus relaxed and nourished versus drained and made sure his strawberry people were those who left him feeling the former.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>A strategy for everyone</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Inspired by the impact this little change made in his life, Finch posted about the strawberry people strategy in a thread on <a href=\"https://x.com/samdylanfinch/status/1112090703713038336?t=xl8MmQBmNN90Lwwi4Hm7Nw&amp;s=19\">X</a>, which is likely where social psychologist Devon Price heard about it. Price included the strategy in their book <em>Unmasking Autism</em>, which was where psychotherapist Michaia Walker heard about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“The meta conversation, the conversation about the relationship, is normalized in romance and not enough in friendship.”</p><cite>Sam Dylan Finch</cite></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walker, who practices virtually from their home in New York City, began talking about the strategy with clients earlier this year. “It’s really similar to a concept of ‘safe people’ that we often use with folks with neurodivergence,” they say. People with autism are often encouraged to find “safe” friends who they can let their guards down around and not worry about being themselves, said Walker, and the strawberry people method can be super helpful for keeping track of those people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In times of crisis, or in moments when you need to find a person to lean on, most people reflexively turn to family members or the friends they see most often, Walker said. But those might not actually be the people who can best support you emotionally. Attaching a strawberry emoji to the friends with whom you feel emotional intimacy provides a good visual reminder and mental shortcut, Walker said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Walker said that this strategy could be really helpful for anybody looking for ways to track and maintain emotionally close friendships, whether you’re neurodivergent or not. And you can make it your own. If you wanted to differentiate your strawberry people a little more, you could, for example, “put a strawberry and a suitcase for work friends, and then a strawberry and a flower for regular friends,” they say.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You could choose a different meaning of the strawberry, or a different emoji, based on the aspect of friendship you’re trying to focus on. You could even teach this method to kids to help them learn from a young age what a healthy and emotionally safe friendship is supposed to feel like, said Walker.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>How to make this work for you&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re interested in implementing this strategy, Walker recommends starting small, with just three to five strawberry people at first. If you’re not used to actively cultivating friendships, having more than a few strawberry friends can be overwhelming. But depending on your capacity and what you want out of your social life, “you can build up to 10 or more,” Walker said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Their suggestions align well with psychologists’ understanding of our social bandwidths. Given our own limited tanks of social and emotional energy, no one is capable of maintaining huge numbers of close friends. In fact, the evolutionary psychologist Robin Dunbar has posited that we only have the capacity to maintain <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1364661317302243\">three to five very close friendships</a> at a time, though his research suggests we can have up to 15 “best” friends (your main social circle and the friends you might turn to for favors like child care) and 50 “good” friends (your “big-weekend-barbecue people,” as <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2021/05/robin-dunbar-explains-circles-friendship-dunbars-number/618931/\">Dunbar</a> has described them).&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once you have your designated strawberry people, decide what purposefully building a friendship means to you. Do you want to check in regularly with them? Or are these simply the friends who you’ll always respond to in a timely manner? Clearly outlining how your treatment of these friendships will differ from others will help crystallize the meaning of the strawberry.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Finch, who uses this strategy to this day, said he’s found the strawberry people method most impactful when you tell your friends what you’re doing. You don’t necessarily have to say “you’re one of my strawberry people,” he said — “that requires more explanation than is actually necessary” — but it can be nice to voice to them that you want to be intentional about cultivating your friendship.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The meta conversation, the conversation about the relationship, is normalized in romance and not enough in friendship,” said Finch. But that conversation can be so powerful because, unless you tell them, “it’s difficult for people to know how important they are to you.” Telling someone that you are serious about your friendship can help make sure you’re on the same page and invites them to make this a joint endeavor.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When talking about strawberry people, Finch likes to remind folks that it’s not about ranking your friends or creating some exclusive top tier. “We’re not doing a MySpace Top 8,” he said. Rather, for him, the strawberry emoji is simply an indicator of where he can find kind and fulfilling friendships and a reminder that these are the folks he wants to intentionally build closeness with.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The strawberry emoji is also not a permanent designation; people can gain or lose strawberry emojis or seedling emojis over time. “I think of it like tending a garden,” Finch said.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Meanwhile, Vice President Delcy Rodríguez has stepped up to be Venezuela’s interim leader — and has already received fresh <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-venezuela-maduro-delcy-rodriguez/685497/\">threats</a> from President Donald Trump if she refuses to comply with US guidance. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Amid the tumult, how are people in Venezuela feeling? Ana Vanessa Herrero, a reporter based in Caracas, says that the mood among Venezuelans has been something of a mixed bag. Some are celebrating; some are losing sleep over the conflict; others are gathering supplies in case the US launches more attacks — which Trump <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/us/venezuelas-maduro-custody-trump-says-us-will-run-country-2026-01-04/\">said</a> the US is prepared to do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Today, Explained</em> co-host Noel King spoke with Herrero about what she’s seeing and hearing in Venezuela, and what the sentiment in Venezuela tells us about what might happen next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full podcast, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/trumps-chief-culture-warrior/id1346207297?i=1000725937911\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://pandora.app.link/jgYqd4gxyWb\">Pandora</a>, and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/5oPbXLokOOJp6SmihchBtz?si=786ca5a143a94e34\">Spotify</a>.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP4537341565\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>It’s great to be able to talk to you, especially since you filled us in on what was going on a few weeks ago. What&#8217;s going on now?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Everything&#8217;s going on. Since Saturday, people have been wondering what is going to happen next. In just 48 hours, Venezuelans experienced not only the first bombing and the first glimpse of war that they have experienced for hundreds of years now, but also they had to face the fact that Nicolas Maduro is no longer here. And that happened just in a couple of hours. That is an historic moment for Venezuelans who oppose Maduro, but also for those who follow him.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What are people in the streets saying? And is it safe to be out on the street today?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I tried to wait as long as I could to see what was going on [Saturday], and then to my surprise, no military on the streets, no cops on the streets, no danger whatsoever. People were just wandering and trying to line up in front of supermarkets and pharmacies to get water, food, supplies, whatever they could just to avoid being off guard in case something else happened.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The same image was repeated on Sunday. And now, people are just trying to get back to normal. We see malls opening [for] a shorter period of time, maybe for a few hours.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Such calm after such a storm is not something that you would expect. And some people tell me that it&#8217;s not normal. I spoke to someone, an elderly woman, and she said that in all of her years living in Venezuela and being born here, she felt so stressed that she just wanted to go to sleep and figure it out later. And I hear a lot of people are having trouble sleeping. They&#8217;re not feeling safe going to bed because they&#8217;re scared that the bombings could resume.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Even when I hear a sound that sounds like a plane, I immediately start looking around, getting nervous, trying to figure out what&#8217;s going on.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Let&#8217;s talk about Delcy Rodriguez. Who is she and who is she aligned with?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Delcy Rodriguez has been a long-time critic of not only the US policies against Venezuela, but against South America. And she has been a fierce critic of Trump and Trump&#8217;s approach against Nicolas Maduro. She has a very, very strong leftist background. She is the daughter of a leftist leader, and she was very close to [leftist dictator] <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/9/19/16189742/venezuela-maduro-dictator-chavez-collapse\">Hugo Chavez</a>, who gave her the first chance to be part of the government with him. And then she became a powerful name after Chavez died, working closely with Nicolas Maduro. So no wonder why her sudden change of tone is raising some eyebrows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You say her tone is changing. What exactly has been happening with her?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, on Saturday she said that what happened to Maduro was a kidnapping and it was illegal, and she urged the US government and Trump to bring him back to Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And then less than 24 hours later, or maybe a day later, she sat down with all the ministers of the former Maduro government and she invited the US to work together on a joint agenda. And she didn&#8217;t explain further, but I think there&#8217;s no need. That phrase alone was enough to raise some eyebrows. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What do you think happened exactly? Why&#8217;d she change her tune?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I&#8217;m not sure, but I can suspect that the threats that Donald Trump made against her if she didn&#8217;t comply [with US demands] had something to do with it. We don&#8217;t know. I mean, is she going to change laws to favor the US? Is she going to resume the diplomatic relations between the US and Venezuela? We have no idea what working together on a joint agenda means, but for sure it&#8217;s interesting to hear.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>We do know what is motivating the United States here, in part because President Trump came right out on Saturday, gave a press conference and said, “We want Venezuela&#8217;s oil.”</strong><em> </em><strong>In Venezuela, how did people hear that remark? What was the response?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Well, people are so focused on how to survive the next few hours and days. That wasn&#8217;t part of the conversation up until very recently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I have been talking to a lot of people on the ground and some of them are addressing that issue, but not all of them. So the ones who tell me that, some of them say they don&#8217;t want anyone running the country — Venezuela for Venezuelans.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, you have the other extreme, and it&#8217;s people saying, “You know what? If the US wants to run the country, then great, as long as they didn&#8217;t do it with Nicolas Maduro.” What they all agree on is that they really don&#8217;t know what that means, “running the country.” And I think no one knows.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Ana, what are people hoping for next? When you ask people what they would like to see happen, what do you hear?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">They would like elections. The mood around people who are actually talking about the future, elections are a huge part of it. In 2024, as you can recall, Venezuela had presidential elections and those results were not recognized by Nicolas Maduro, who claimed himself as a victor without any proof. Now, I think people have that feeling of, “We now need our fair elections again.” I mean, we need to, and the Constitution says that in case of an absolute total void of power in the presidency, then the vice president should fill that void immediately and call for elections in the next 30 days. We don&#8217;t know if that is going to happen because the circumstances right now are unprecedented for Venezuelans. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Venezuelans right now are trying to get out of the state of shock and they&#8217;re trying to get as much food and water as they can, because they&#8217;re accustomed to problems, turmoil and tragedy, and they feel that something else might happen.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

President Donald Trump’s invasion of Venezuela over the weekend has, understandably, been the leading story of the day, and you can find Vox’s continuing coverage of the attack and its implications <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473967/us-venezuela-trump-maduro-oil-crisis-rodriguez\">here</a>. But the newsletter is focusing on another big story out of the Trump administration this evening: major changes to the pediatric vaccine schedule. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What just happened?</strong> On Monday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention slashed the number of routine vaccines recommended for children in the US from 17 to 11 and shifted several shots into two additional categories: those recommended only for high-risk groups, and those available subject to “shared clinical decision-making.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Shots in the latter category, including those for Covid-19, flu, and rotavirus, would first require a conversation with a health care provider.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why does this matter?</strong> These changes will unquestionably make some childhood vaccines less available by creating new barriers to access. They also add more confusion to an already fractured US public health consensus, contrary to the Trump administration’s protestations that the change is needed to restore faith in public health.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the big picture?</strong> The previous US vaccine schedule existed for a reason: It was the product of a rigorous, evidence-based process by experts at the CDC. This one was not; there was no public process leading up to Monday’s announcement, and CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, or ACIP, was not involved. (Though it’s unclear if the result would have been different: ACIP was purged last year by Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who installed <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2025/06/13/nx-s1-5429604/cdc-rfk-acip-vaccine-committee\">several anti-vaccine advocates</a> to the new panel.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How does this compare to other countries?</strong> Denmark, which the Trump administration has invoked as a rationale for the updated recommendations, does recommend fewer vaccines than the US. Experts, however, say that isn’t a good reason to change US policy, citing Denmark’s vastly smaller size and easier access to health care.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">And with that, it’s time to log off…</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It might feel like longer, but we’re just five days into the new year.

Tomorrow, it could be any nation that refuses to submit.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the request of Colombia, the UN Security Council met to discuss whether President Donald Trump’s actions were legal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Colombia’s leader was also threatened by Trump: “Colombia is very sick too,” he told reporters aboard Air Force One. “Run by a sick man who likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States. And he’s not going to be doing it very long, let me tell you.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the time since Maduro’s capture early Saturday morning, Trump has also threatened Cuba, Greenland, Iran, and Mexico.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Greg Grandin, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian at Yale University and the author of the 2025 book <em><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/747326/america-america-by-greg-grandin/\">America, America</a></em>, told <em>Today, Explained</em> host Noel King this fits into a long pattern of US behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There is no country in which the United States hasn&#8217;t intervened in South America, in Central America,” Grandin told King. “By some counts between 1898 and 1992, the United States successfully was involved in over 40 regime changes.”</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e=VMP4537341565\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity.

Where did you say, we&#8217;re just doing this again?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You see elements of different interventions. Certainly the invasion of Panama is one that comes up immediately:&nbsp; The United States sent Marines into Panama to <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2026/01/03/trump-venezuela-maduro-panama-noriega\">capture Manuel Noriega</a> who, in the 1980s during the late Cold War, was a CIA asset. Problem was also that he was deeply involved with a lot of drug running, as are a number of US allies during this period.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It was important for a number of reasons. One, it was a showcase of Colin Powell’s exit strategy doctrine that you had to have a clear idea of what you were going in for and what you were getting out for. And also it was the first that eventually was understood as an intervention to install democracy, to defend democracy, as opposed to national security or anti-communism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it was a unilateral intervention. Everybody, every country in the OAS, the Organization of American States, was opposed to it. The United Nations was opposed to it. And so many observers see this as a kind of turning point leading to Iraq in 2003, in the sense that it was the beginning of the United States acting unilaterally or outside the channels of the United Nations or the Organization of American States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You know, I&#8217;m old enough to remember Iraq. What I don&#8217;t remember is the United States, its leadership being so explicit about the oil. This [past] weekend, President Trump came out and he said, we want the oil. That&#8217;s why we did this. Did that surprise you?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">No. And I don&#8217;t think —&nbsp;I&#8217;m not one of these scholars who think that it&#8217;s all about the oil. Obviously oil is important. Oil plays a factor. But there&#8217;s lots of ways of getting oil, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Yes!&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And the Trump administration could have negotiated with Maduro, as elements within the administration wanted to do. I think Trump&#8217;s talking about oil was kind of a way of providing [a] fig leaf for his America First base.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of those nationalists, they don&#8217;t want to do regime change. They don&#8217;t want to rebuild world economies and have the United States superintend the global economy. But when you put it in tough guy terms, and when you put it in the terms of plunder and “we&#8217;re going to take the oil,” tou know, it resonates with certain sectors of America First nationalism and aggrieved nationalism.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>“You do not have to carry water for Nicolás Maduro; you do not have to support or defend Nicolás Maduro in any way to hold on to the ideal of national sovereignty.”</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So I&#8217;m not saying oil wasn&#8217;t important, but I&#8217;m saying Trump&#8217;s move from immigration to drugs and then to oil was really just a kind of trying out different ways of justifying what they wanted to do. And it goes back to this idea of the Monroe Doctrine — that the United States will police the hemisphere.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Let me ask you about an argument that I saw circulating this weekend. Nicolás Maduro was in power in Venezuela for more than 10 years. During this time, as you know, the economy craters. Eight million people flee. They flee repression. They flee censorship, fake elections, people being disappeared into prisons and tortured. What do you say to the argument that this was just the right thing for the United States of America to do?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You do not have to carry water for Nicolás Maduro; you do not have to support or defend Nicolás Maduro in any way to hold on to the ideal of national sovereignty. There is a system of international law which recognizes the sovereignty of nations —&nbsp;the absolute sovereignty of nations.&nbsp; It shouldn&#8217;t be left to the judgment of one nation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">International law is something that is always being destroyed. It’s a phrase that people use: “It weakens international law.” International law is always being weakened. But this certainly is a major step in that direction.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The idea that the United States can claim for itself the sole jurisdiction and power to decide what country&#8217;s sovereignty is legitimate, then to go a step further and then to kind of cosplay colonial plundering and say we&#8217;re doing it because of the oil. We&#8217;re not doing it because of democracy. We&#8217;re not doing it because we care about human rights. We&#8217;re doing it because we want to get the oil. I mean, I think that&#8217;s what Trump brings to the table. He pulls out some of the implicit or repressed premises of the power dynamics of the international order and just says them out loud.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>A couple hours after this news broke on Saturday, I got a text from a Cuban American friend and the text just said, “Cuba next.” And I watched the president&#8217;s press conference and heard Marco Rubio speak, and a lot of people started saying that day, “Cuba next.” What do you think is coming next?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I do think the long game ultimately goes beyond Cuba, I think Cuba may be next. But what we see in the Trump administration is an attempt to bring Latin America to heel, not just Cuba, not just Venezuela, not just Nicaragua. but also what we might call these social democratic regimes: The Workers&#8217; Party governed by Lula in Brazil and Claudia Sheinbaum in Mexico.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">These represent not so much confrontational challenges to the United States, but a kind of intolerable independence and autonomy. A country like Brazil is insisting on doing business with China, for instance, and finding ways to weaken US economic influence so it could diversify its trading partners. These are totally legitimate actions, but if we envision Latin America, as a place that Trump wants to show dominance, then they&#8217;re intolerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What it really is is about demonstrations of power and will. You know, Hegseth said the other day that nothing can prevent us from doing what we want in Latin America. And Trump said, effectively, the same thing. This is really about bringing Latin America —&nbsp;all of Latin America — to heel and bringing Trump allies to power. Latin America really is on a knife&#8217;s edge.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

JD Vance <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/trumps-best-foreign-policy-not-starting-any-wars-ukraine-russia-war-rocket-nuclear-power-weapons-defense-11675186959?utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=ncl_amplify&amp;utm_campaign=230131-icymi_endorsement_of_president_donald_j_trump_by_us_senator_jd_vance&amp;utm_content=ncl-test123&amp;_nlid=5UeQQZhgeG&amp;_nhids=w5VS7YR\">endorsed President Donald Trump’s presidential bid</a> for one big reason: Trump’s commitment to peace. “He has my support in 2024,” Vance wrote, “because I know he won’t recklessly send Americans to fight overseas.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Flash-forward to 2026, and Vice President Vance has been <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398\">put in the awkward position</a> of defending one of the most reckless US military raids of my lifetime: an explicit attempt <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473953/trump-maduro-regime-change\">to bring about regime change in Venezuela</a> by abducting its president from his bed. </p>\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-vox-media-highlight vox-media-highlight\">\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Key takeaways</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>There is a long-standing myth that Donald Trump is a dove. This myth has always been at odds with reality, but after the seizure of Nicolás Maduro, it is simply indefensible.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The myth stems from a refusal either to grapple with Trump’s record in office or to take his long-standing commitments to neo-imperialism seriously.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Now, Trump’s particular brand of hawkish politics threatens to usher in a new era of global disorder.</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is not an exaggeration. Trump said during a Saturday press conference that America now “runs” post-Maduro Venezuela. Administration officials <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/world/americas/trump-venezuela-leader-rodriguez-machado.html\">have said </a>that the country’s vice president, Delcy Rodriguez, will <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-venezuela-maduro-delcy-rodriguez/685497/?gift=nHf7iWmpOKBdlkwz68mfUL0TpyXmVnmvEqoerglxbqw&amp;utm_source=copy-link&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_campaign=share\">either rule according to American dictates or else</a>. One of those dictates is that American oil companies be allowed to extract Venezuelan crude — and that the proceeds of their sales be used to finance US military activity in the country.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In essence, Trump is demanding Venezuela will become an American imperial vassal and pay for the privilege. If they do not, they will face a “a second and much larger attack” —&nbsp;and potentially even an invasion.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“We’re not afraid of boots on the ground,” as Trump put it on Saturday.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We may not get that far. Perhaps Rodriguez will strike some kind of deal, or Trump’s threats will prove to be empty. It wouldn’t be the first time.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the fact that the US is even attempting a kind of regime change by protection racket, one that began with the brazen abduction of a foreign leader, is proof that Vance and the <a href=\"https://compactmag.com/article/trump-s-real-crime-is-opposing-empire\">many</a>, <a href=\"https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1856081414145319090\">many</a>, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/opinion/sunday/donald-the-dove-hillary-the-hawk.html\">many </a><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/opinion/trump-foreign-policy.html\">others</a> who insisted that Trump is some kind of dove have been taken for a ride (which <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2016/5/27/11608580/donald-trump-foreign-policy-war-iraq-hillary-clinton\">was obvious to me from the start</a>).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One question now is why they missed that reality. But the much bigger one is what Trump’s particular brand of hawkishness means for the country&nbsp;— and the world.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Yes, war for oil</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly 10 years ago, New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd published a column titled “<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/01/opinion/sunday/donald-the-dove-hillary-the-hawk.html\">Donald the Dove, Hillary the Hawk.</a>” In Dowd’s telling, Trump “thought the invasion of Iraq was a stupid idea.” While “he can sound belligerent,” he actually “would rather do the art of the deal than shock and awe.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Nearly every part of this analysis was wrong — <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2016/5/27/11608580/donald-trump-foreign-policy-war-iraq-hillary-clinton\">demonstrably wrong at the time</a>. Trump had not opposed George W. Bush’s invasion of Iraq in advance; <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/andrewkaczynski/in-2002-donald-trump-said-he-supported-invading-iraq-on-the\">he had publicly supported it</a>. He had also supported the 2011 US war in Libya and was calling for US intervention in the Syrian civil war on the campaign trail.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But while Dowd’s op-ed was demonstrably wrong, her basic frame — that Trump is the non-interventionist antidote to the hawkish bipartisan consensus — quickly became one of the dominant ways politicians and analysts described Trump. This was, in large part, at his own encouragement.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“If Kamala wins, only death and destruction await because she is the candidate of endless wars,” <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2024/11/01/2024-elections-live-coverage-updates-analysis/trump-liz-cheney-michigan-rally-00186883\">Trump said during the 2024 campaign</a>. “I am the candidate of peace.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This view has indeed become central to the Trump mythos, repeated both by his allies and third party observers.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Good leaders don’t foment pointless wars. They end them. If you voted for Donald Trump, that’s reason enough to be proud you did,” <a href=\"https://x.com/TuckerCarlson/status/1856081414145319090\">Tucker Carlson said</a> after the 2024 election. Christian Parenti, a Marxist economist, <a href=\"https://compactmag.com/article/trump-s-real-crime-is-opposing-empire\">wrote an essay in Compact</a> arguing that Trump “has done more to restrain the US imperium than any politician in 75 years.” Even NPR, in an ostensibly straight-news writeup from earlier this year, <a href=\"https://www.kpbs.org/news/politics/2025/06/17/trump-threatens-irans-supreme-leader-escalating-his-rhetoric-about-the-conflict\">wrote that</a> “Trump has long been known for his ‘America First’ ethos and non-interventionist stance.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This all was totally at odds with his first-term record (more on that in a second). But it’s also at odds with Trump’s own explicitly stated worldview, in which “America First” is less about avoiding foreign wars than advancing narrowly defined American interests through more nakedly imperialistic politics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let’s take one issue of particular relevance to Venezuela: Trump’s longstanding preoccupation with seizing foreign oil deposits. While that isn’t the sole motivation of the Maduro abduction, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473986/maduro-venezuela-invasion-war-trump-oil\">doesn’t really make sense as a practical matter</a>, it’s clear that it played a major role in Trump’s mind&nbsp;— as it has for years.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In 1987, he called on the US<a href=\"https://www.newspapers.com/article/tampa-bay-times-dems-fall-in-love-with-t/18494889/\"> to invade Iran and take its oil</a>. In 2011, he proposed an imperial US intervention in the Libyan civil war: &#8220;I’m only interested in Libya if we take the oil.” In 2013, he explained his evolution on Iraq — from war supporter to critic — as a kind of disillusionment with the US refusal to do naked imperialism.</p>\n<img src=\"https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2026/01/gettyimages-1227832507.jpg?quality=90&#038;strip=all&#038;crop=0,0,100,100\" alt=\"Trump stands with his fist in the air\" title=\"Trump stands with his fist in the air\" data-has-syndication-rights=\"1\" data-caption=\"President Donald Trump gestures after delivering a speech at a Double Eagle Energy Holdings, LLC, oil rig in Midland, Texas, on Wednesday, July 29, 2020. | Cooper Neill/Bloomberg/Getty Images\" data-portal-copyright=\"Cooper Neill/Bloomberg/Getty Images\" />\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">&#8220;When I heard that we were first going into Iraq, some very smart people told me, ‘Well, we’re actually going for the oil,’ and I said, ‘All right, I get that.&#8217; [But] we didn&#8217;t take the oil!&#8221; the future president said in a 2013 speech.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And, in 2019, as president, he sent US troops to seize Syrian oil fields, claiming “<a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/keeping-oil-syria-trump-considered-war-crime/story?id=66589757\">we’re keeping the oil</a>” to be developed by ExxonMobil at a future date. This plan went nowhere — partly because Exxon itself <a href=\"https://www.eenews.net/articles/trump-has-long-claimed-us-can-take-other-countries-oil/\">refused to play ball</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But in Trump’s second term, his policy id has been unleashed. There are no more “adults in the room,” like Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who saw their job as protecting US foreign policy from the man in charge of it. Instead, the current Trump administration is made up of various competing sub-factions trying to influence his instincts. Vance is a genuine isolationist; Marco Rubio is an uber-hawk with a longstanding preference for regime change. They are all trying to sway Trump to their point of view by trying to sell their own positions as the best expression of his.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rubio has figured out that the language of crude national interests —&nbsp;of seizing oil deposits for US corporations, or fighting “narco-terrorism,” or asserting American power — taps directly into the particular kind of hawkishness that Trump has consistently expressed for decades.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Hence how you can have what is, in effect, Rubio’s longstanding preference for regime change in Venezuela enacted by a president who has long pretended to oppose regime change wars.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The myopia of “no new wars”</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">When pressed on these sorts of points, the defenders of Trump-as-peace-candidate have long fallen back on the same line: that Trump did not start any “new wars” during his first term. Vance wrote this in his 2023 op-ed; Curt Mills, the editor of the non-interventionist American Conservative magazine, made the same point in a 2024 piece arguing that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/13/opinion/trump-foreign-policy.html\">Trump’s second term would be a peaceful one</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This line was always a sleight of hand distracting from how Trump dramatically escalated the wars in which America was already involved.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In Iraq and Syria, for example, he removed Obama-era limitations on the use of force designed to prevent civilian casualties, leading to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23677654/trump-foreign-policy-revisionist-history-dove-anti-imperial\">three times as many civilian deaths</a> from US bombs as in in the 1991 Gulf War, the 1998–1999 Kosovo intervention, and the Libya war combined. It’s absurd to call a president with this kind of body count a dove, especially when the civilian death toll from US air wars dropped dramatically after Biden took office.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But it also ignored the way in which Trump frequently took risks that could easily produce a full-scale conflict. In 2017, for example, he threatened North Korea with “fire and fury”&nbsp;and moved US naval assets nearby, bringing us <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2017/12/18/16733560/north-korea-war\">far closer to war with a nuclear-armed power</a> than most people remember. In 2020, he assassinated top Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani — an outright act of war with the Islamic Republic that could <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/23677654/trump-foreign-policy-revisionist-history-dove-anti-imperial\">easily have spun out of control</a>.</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote\"><blockquote><p>Once you understand Trump’s foreign policy as an essentially belligerent one, you begin to appreciate the full enormity of our new era of global politics.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump, in short, had proved himself willing to <em>risk</em> new wars in his first term frequently.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s clear that he didn’t necessarily want his provocations to escalate; he has a preference for shows of force over actual invasions. But it’s also the case that once you start down a road toward conflict, things don’t always go the way you want. Maybe Trump’s first term avoidance of new wars in term one was the result of deft diplomacy on Trump’s party, the sheer intimidating power of the US military, or the restrained policy choices of his targets. But it also could be attributed to luck.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his second term, Trump seems determined to push that luck to the brink.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His bombing of Iran’s nuclear site, for example, avoided the most dire predictions of immediate escalations. But, Iran <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/09/26/iran-underground-nuclear-us/?pwapi_token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJyZWFzb24iOiJnaWZ0IiwibmJmIjoxNzU4ODU5MjAwLCJpc3MiOiJzdWJzY3JpcHRpb25zIiwiZXhwIjoxNzYwMjQxNTk5LCJpYXQiOjE3NTg4NTkyMDAsImp0aSI6IjkwY2NkZDZkLWFhMWItNDBmZS04NGRlLTEyNTU0MGExODQzYSIsInVybCI6Imh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lndhc2hpbmd0b25wb3N0LmNvbS9uYXRpb25hbC1zZWN1cml0eS8yMDI1LzA5LzI2L2lyYW4tdW5kZXJncm91bmQtbnVjbGVhci11cy8ifQ.lXKUu7dSPTzdEj9BvQbpzlmqGxILKEwKWrwvqIpIzTc\">appears to be rebuilding</a> its nuclear capabilities, and Trump is now threatening more attacks over <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-29/trump-vows-to-strike-iran-again-if-it-rebuilds-nuclear-program\">both the nuclear program</a> and <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q4z33pnnyo\">the country’s repression of protesters</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">His policy of drone strikes on drug traffickers in the Caribbean, allegedly aimed at stamping out “narco-terrorism,” seems to have opened the door to the abduction of Maduro, which the White House has justified as a law enforcement action aimed at putting him on trial on drug-related charges.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And now, the immediate question is whether that hawkishness will escalate to a broader war with Venezuela if the country refuses to comply with Trump’s demands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Currently, Delcy Rodriguez is striking a defiant tone, saying in a Saturday speech that “we shall never be a colony ever again.” Trump is threatening retaliatory escalation, telling <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-venezuela-maduro-delcy-rodriguez/685497/\">The Atlantic on Sunday</a> that “if she doesn’t do what’s right, she is going to pay a very big price, probably bigger than Maduro.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If Rodriguez remains in power and defiant, Trump will have two choices: Do nothing and expose his threats as empty, or make good on them. If it’s the latter, his belligerence could lead to an escalation of catastrophic proportions.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">An unstable world</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Once you understand Trump&#8217;s foreign policy as an essentially belligerent one, you begin to appreciate the full enormity of our new era of global politics.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s not as if the United States hasn’t been warlike in the past. This isn’t even the first time that the US has launched an invasion to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/04/politics/noriega-trial-maduro-legal-battle\">forcibly arrest a Latin American dictator</a> whom it accused of involvement in drug trafficking.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Rather, it’s that American belligerency in the post-World War II era has followed certain predictable rules and guidelines that limited the overall systemic impact of even acts of aggression. The United States was, for all its faults, widely understood as the anchor of an international order it created; charges of hypocrisy in places like Vietnam had bite because of the stated commitment to basic ideas like sovereignty and human rights.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">There’s good evidence that the predictability and strength of the US-led alliance system, however imperfect, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world/2018/6/12/17448866/trump-south-korea-alliance-trudeau-g7\">played a major role in deterring aggression in the latter 20th century</a>. After World War II, the number and severity of wars between states steadily declined, leading to a dramatic drop in the rate of people killed by war relative to historical averages. The term “Pax Americana” was not entirely a misnomer, even when you factor in America’s criminally brutal Cold War policies in places ranging from Vietnam, to Argentina, to Indonesia.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The 2003 invasion of Iraq, with its brazen indifference to international law, weakened faith in the US-led order. Trump’s first term hollowed it out. And now, the naked imperial violence of his second&nbsp;might have well and truly shattered it. Trump is making a series of wild threats and territorial claims, forcing Mexico <a href=\"https://zeteo.com/p/trump-venezuela-mexico-invasion-attack-cartels\">to prepare for a potentially imminent US invasion</a> and Denmark to <a href=\"https://x.com/Mij_Europe/status/2007844467076911146\">take recent US threats to seize Greenland seriousl</a>y.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What this new world disorder looks like is hard to say. Seva Gunitsky, a political scientist at the University of Toronto, suggested one model after the Maduro operation — a kind of regional “carve-up” in which the US, Russia, and China each get to do what they want in their respective spheres of influence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What just happened is entirely consistent with the spheres-of-influence approach that Putin has long advocated, and that Trump embraced in the latest National Security Strategy. The emerging order is one in which Putin, Xi, and Trump each get to do whatever they want in their respective zones: a grand bargain among the powerful at the expense of everyone else,” <a href=\"https://hegemon.substack.com/p/venezuela-is-a-gift-to-putin\">he wrote</a>. “For ‘smaller’ places caught in the gray zones, like Ukraine, Taiwan, the Baltics, even Greenland, this is not an abstract theoretical debate but a question of survival.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But this is just one possibility. The truth is that an unconstrained Trump, acting on his longstanding hawkish impulses, could cause all sorts of chaos in his remaining three years. While US military interventionism is very precedented, Trump’s particular brand of it — naked pre-modern imperialism backed by a modern globe-spanning military — is not.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Americans should be prepared for things to go very, very wrong.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

But if you were born in the 1980s or 1990s, you probably remember a different time: the days of logging into a computer at your local library or in your family room, printing song lyrics, writing in your LiveJournal, or mulling over your MySpace Top 8.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Those days are long behind us, but Max Read remembers this era too. He’s a writer and has a Substack called Read Max, all about technology and culture.<strong> </strong>“I would go to link aggregating sites like <a href=\"https://www.fark.com/\">FARK</a>,” he said on a recent episode of <em>Explain It to Me, </em>Vox’s weekly call-in podcast. “When I was a little older, Metafilter was another one. There&#8217;d be discussions in the comments and you would get linked out to other websites that you could find and discover web comics and bloggers and whatever else.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Read says it was a much different landscape than the one we have online now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“There were fewer mega platforms — by which I mean these huge sites that became the whole internet for people. Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, places where you go and you can spend hours without ever leaving that particular website,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So what caused this shift in the internet? And was the change inevitable? Read tells us on the latest episode of <em>Explain It to Me. </em>Below is an excerpt of our conversation, edited for length and clarity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">You can listen to the full episode on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/explain-it-to-me/id1042433083\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/1vSUO6Bg4abtjRF7fnGpT1\">Spotify</a>, or wherever you get podcasts.

How did the internet get this way?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I would say there&#8217;s two big shifts. The first one happened almost 20 years ago. In 2006, Facebook introduced the newsfeed. People revolted, they hated it. But what Facebook was seeing on the back end was that all of their numbers were up. Engagement was up, time on site was up, visitors were up. People kept coming back from more. And the feed has become the paradigm for how we engage with the internet ever since.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then the second change — which is an acceleration of something that was already happening — was TikTok introducing the For You page as a concept. You go to TikTok because TikTok has this incredibly dialed-in algorithm that&#8217;s going to show you weird videos as you scroll through it. That&#8217;s the other change that created this really wholly separate kind of antisocial internet that we&#8217;re on now.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Has the algorithm killed the internet?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yes and no.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think it&#8217;s worth keeping in mind the algorithm also brought the internet to what it is today: [the] size it is today, the engagement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think something that is worth grappling with is what Mark Zuckerberg would say if he was on this podcast with us: you guys can complain about this. But every single time we&#8217;ve made one of these moves, the numbers have shown that people spend more time on Facebook. They want to be there more. They enjoy the time spent. They feel like it was better spent.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Are we conflating time spent and actually liking a thing ?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing to think about is that all of the metrics that Facebook is gathering tell us something fairly narrow. But it is also true that when they interview people, people will say they felt like their time was better spent with the algorithmic, FYP-type feeds than with the way Facebook was 10 years ago.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Was this trashy, toxic internet inevitable? Can a website grow and make money and be a place that brings in an audience without ruining itself?&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think a website that shows us a different path is Wikipedia, which is as big by the numbers as basically any of the platforms we&#8217;re talking about, and is arguably more essential to the web as we know it than even Facebook.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In that sense, to answer your question, no, it&#8217;s not inevitable in the absolute sense that a huge important website will turn into shit. The culture of Wikipedia as formulated by Jimmy Wales and the many people who&#8217;ve worked at the Wikimedia Foundation over the years — and by the volunteers who contribute and edit and monitor and otherwise work on Wikipedia — the culture of Wikipedia has been a really important factor in ensuring that it maintains itself as a free resource for anyone online.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think that part of the problem with many of the big platforms we&#8217;re talking about isn&#8217;t merely that there&#8217;s a set of structural incentives that is pushing them into the darker corners of what they&#8217;re doing, but that the overall culture of Silicon Valley isn&#8217;t one that values any of the things we&#8217;re talking about.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Max, you and I are millennials. Could it be that we&#8217;ve just aged out of the internet? That we are no longer the target audience?</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I mean, I hate to break it to you. We are old…</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Oh no!</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Unfortunately, we have reached middle age. Millennials like us, we were the protagonists of the internet for a really long time, because we were the people who grew up on it. We were the people who in our office knew the most about it. We were the people who created most of the content first on most of the social networks.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And we&#8217;re not the protagonists anymore. Some of that is aging-out. Some of that is, there are people who are even more raised by the internet than we were, who have been online for an even higher percentage of their lives.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And I think the other part of it is that the internet we see on all these websites now is really a truly global internet. In some sense there&#8217;s a lot of stuff we don&#8217;t see. There&#8217;s also a lot of stuff we see that just isn&#8217;t for us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That&#8217;s maybe slightly separate from the question of “Are the structures of the internet worse off than they were 20 years ago?” Because I think it&#8217;s true, but the old internet&#8217;s gone, it&#8217;s not coming back. So it&#8217;s people — I think people are aged. The best you can do is retreat to your group chats.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The pair now face drug trafficking and narco-terrorism charges in New York, while observers in both countries are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473953/trump-maduro-regime-change\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">scrambling to interpret</a>&nbsp;the sudden action by President Donald Trump, which followed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473935/trump-venezuela-attack-maduro-arrest-criminal-charges-what-to-know\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">months of escalating tension</a>&nbsp;between Venezuela and the US.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump himself seemed to suggest that oil played a major role in his decision to strike now, telling reporters on Saturday that American oil companies will soon “go in, spend billions of dollars [and] fix the badly broken infrastructure” that has hamstrung Venezuela’s oil production for well over a decade.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473986/maduro-venezuela-invasion-war-trump-oil\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">As a justification for invading, though, that actually doesn’t make much sense</a>: America has plenty of oil already, and the type of oil on offer in Venezuela is expensive and difficult to extract, says my colleague Eric Levitz. In other words, oil isn’t the easy explanation that many commentators seem to think it is.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the US and Venezuela do have a long, tangled, and fascinating history around oil — a history that has undeniably shaped the economy, politics, and culture of Venezuela over the past 100 years. So even if Maduro’s capture isn’t “about the oil,” per se, the boom-and-bust story of US oil interests in Venezuela does very much inform how we got here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Venezuelan oil was dominant early</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, Venezuela accounts for only <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/venezuelan-oil-industry-worlds-largest-reserves-decaying-infrastructure-2026-01-03/#:~:text=PRODUCTION,Rasmussen%20from%20Global%20Risk%20Management.\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1 percent</a> of world oil production. But the South American country <a href=\"https://www.marketplace.org/story/2016/04/05/how-plummeting-global-oil-prices-have-devastated-venezuela\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ranked</a> among the world’s very top producers from the 1920s, when a large well was discovered at Lake Maracaibo, through the late ’90s. Foreign oil companies — most of them American — dominated the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis#chapter-title-0-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">early Venezuelan industry</a> by the express invitation of the country’s then-dictator General Juan Vicente Gómez.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In exchange for the right to explore and develop oil reserves, firms like Gulf, Shell, and Standard Oil built out <a href=\"https://revista.drclas.harvard.edu/life-in-a-venezuelan-oil-camp/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">entire communities</a> in the Venezuelan countryside, complete with hospitals, schools, bowling alleys, American-style soda fountains, and the largest <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/17/world/americas/trump-venezuela-oil-fields-stolen-claims.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">American expat community</a> in the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the most part, the arrangement worked well for all involved. Venezuela grew rich from oil taxes and royalties: By the mid-1970s, it boasted the <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/venezuela-crisis#chapter-title-0-5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">highest per-capita income</a> in Latin America. US policy in the region at that time, meanwhile, was focused on containing communism and the influence of the Soviet Union. Venezuela, which elected a stable democratic government in 1958, was considered a <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2026/01/02/nx-s1-5652133/us-venezuela-interventionism-caribbean-latin-america-history-trump\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">good partner</a> in that mission — even as its leaders began taking steps to make more money from, and gain more control over, domestic oil production. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>The nationalization of the oil industry was “relatively uncontroversial”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That effort came to a head in 1976, when Venezuela nationalized its domestic oil industry. But as far as nationalization projects go, this one was pretty bloodless. The government bought out foreign firms, including ExxonMobil, Shell, and Chevron, and created a state-owned oil company called Petroleos de Venezuela to take over drilling. The change was “<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/20/venezuela-oil-nationalization-expropriation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">relatively uncontroversial</a>,” one Venezuelan economist told the Washington Post; in fact, Petróleos de Venezuela, or PDVSA, continued to partner with foreign companies.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead, when Trump and his allies refer to Venezuela’s alleged theft of “Oil, Land, and other Assets” from the United States — as he did on Truth Social in December — it seems likely that they’re referencing, albeit inaccurately, a second nationalization effort that took place after former Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez came to power in 1998.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Chávez, a socialist who ran on the promise of ending poverty in Venezuela, clashed repeatedly with the PDVSA as he sought to redirect its revenue to social projects. At the same time, he moved to “<a href=\"https://www.bakerinstitute.org/research/collapse-venezuelan-oil-industry-role-above-ground-risks-limiting-fdi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">forcefully renegotiate</a>” contracts with foreign oil companies, which prompted ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips to leave Venezuela and sue — successfully — over their lost investments.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It wasn’t just American companies that suffered, though: PDVSA was also starved of resources. At one point, Chávez fired more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/the-americas/2014/07/19/brain-haemorrhage\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">18,000 workers</a>. That situation has not improved since Maduro, Chávez’s protege, came to power in 2013. As part of an international effort to oust Maduro after his term ended in 2019, the US imposed harsh sanctions on PDVSA and Venezuela that essentially cut both off from the world oil market.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">The Venezuelan oil industry has collapsed</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, Venezuela produces fewer than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/business/venezuela-oil-industry-trump.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">1 million</a>&nbsp;barrels of oil a day, down from roughly 3.5 million in 1997. Since oil is the basis of the country’s economy — PDVSA remains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eia.gov/international/analysis/country/ven/background\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">its largest employer</a>&nbsp;— that three-decade collapse has transformed Venezuelan life and politics. More than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wilsoncenter.org/blog-post/venezuela-more-mere-numbers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">90 percent of Venezuelans</a>&nbsp;live in poverty, and millions of refugees and migrants have fled the country. Maduro’s administration, meanwhile, has reportedly sought to open its domestic oil industry up once again, quietly granting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/08/world/americas/venezuela-oil-maduro.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more operational control</a>&nbsp;to its international partners.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Earlier this year, in negotiations with the White House, Maduro also reportedly offered even&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-us-oil.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">larger concessions</a>&nbsp;to US companies, promising to open up all existing and future oil projects to US companies and giving preferential contracts to the US. The White House rebuffed that offer and, three months later, captured Maduro instead.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the Today, Explained newsletter.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/today-explained-newsletter-signup\">Sign up here!</a></em><br></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

First, in a wide-ranging New York Times Magazine<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/magazine/marjorie-taylor-greene-trump-maga-split.html\">profile last week</a>, the retiring Georgia representative reignited her feud with the president, admitting to being “just so naïve” about Washington politics since being sworn in and lamenting the wasted potential of the MAGA movement by a do-nothing Congress.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“How did all of this end up to a point,” she complained to the Times’s Robert Draper about her party’s handling of the Epstein files, “where it was about releasing files about women who were raped, and not the serious things that I think truly matter about helping to get our economy stabilized again? Help reduce the cost of living, fix the housing market, fix health insurance — for the love of God, what the [expletive] is the matter with these people?”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Then, following <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473935/trump-venezuela-attack-maduro-arrest-criminal-charges-what-to-know\">the news from Caracas</a>, she posted the following (lengthy) denunciation on X:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-dnt=\"true\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’ve served on the Homeland Security Committee for the past three years. I’m 100% for strong safe secure borders and stopping narco terrorists and cartels from trafficking deadly drugs and human trafficking into America. <br><br>Fentanyl is responsible for over 70% of U.S. drug…</p>&mdash; Rep.

She’s bemoaned how easily Trump critics or saboteurs have laundered their reputations, landed in the White House, or made it into his inner circle. And she’s claimed that most elected Republicans would rather not do anything at all than implement a <em>real</em> MAGA agenda.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The Republicans that I work with…look at [Trump] like a speed bump. Many of them can’t wait to get him out of the way,” she told Tucker Carlson on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/tucker-and-mtg-on-the-5-pillars-of-maga-and/id1719657632?i=1000733066955\">his podcast in October</a>. “So many times for our party…they get on board and they campaign and they say ‘America First’ and they try to utter and mimic these Donald Trump talking points. But when it actually comes to getting to work and delivering those talking points into action for the American people…what are we doing? We&#8217;re sitting at home.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The October to mid-November government shutdown, in particular, seems to have turned her most against her party.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I really have no respect for the House not being in session. And I have no respect for Speaker Johnson not calling us back to Washington because we should be passing bills…that reflect the president’s executive orders, which are exactly what we voted for,” she told Carlson. “We should be at work on our committees. We should be doing investigations…We should be passing the discharge petition that Thomas Massie put in to release the Epstein files…[and] we should be passing our appropriation bills to actually fund the government and fund important projects.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She expanded on this idea of Republicans squandering their power in appearances on cable news, including when she praised Nancy Pelosi’s “ability to get things done” as speaker <a href=\"https://www.aol.com/articles/rep-marjorie-taylor-greene-praises-032547859.html\">on CNN</a> after Pelosi announced her retirement. “I wish we could get things done for our party like Nancy Pelosi was able to deliver for her party.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And she revisited it in her interviews with the Times: the feeling that neither she, nor the House, had any real say in implementing an agenda because Speaker Mike Johnson and GOP leadership would only allow Congress to act as an extension of the White House.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I want you to know that Johnson is not our speaker,” she told the Times in December. The speaker “is literally 100 percent under direct orders from the White House. And many, many Republicans are so furious about that, but they’re cowards.”</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Instead, when Congress and Trump did get to work, they betrayed MAGA</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Paired up with the sense that Congress just wasted a year of unified control of government is Greene’s charge that when Republicans <em>did </em>act, they really only ended up betraying MAGA values and voters.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She describes her last year as one spent as a referee or parent: “What have I been doing since he became president? I’ve worked very hard to keep everybody inside the guardrails of what we campaigned on: ‘No, <em>this</em> is what we said. <em>This</em> is what we promised. Now we have to deliver. And not through executive orders or red-meat rants on social media,’” she told the Times.&nbsp; “And I always go back to the people that showed up at his rallies, because those are the people that should matter. Those people should matter over those big crypto donors or the AI big-tech people.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What <em>do </em>those guardrails look like? She’s specified those red lines over the last few weeks, and how she thinks Trump and congressional Republicans have crossed them:</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead of disentangling America from foreign wars, the administration infiltrated Venezuela and captured its leader, Nicolás Maduro, launched airstrikes against the Houthis in Yemen, bombed Iran, and continues to prop up Ukraine against Russia. Instead of cutting foreign aid, the US sent billions more to Israel, Egypt, Ukraine, and bailed out Argentina.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“I don&#8217;t know how that’s America First,” she told Carlson about that last one. “But what we have going on right now, I mean, seriously, look at it. It&#8217;s a revolving door at the White House, a revolving door of foreign leaders and prime ministers and presidents all with their hands out demanding money and demanding attention and demanding America do this.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">She had a similar critique of the president’s military actions in Venezuela, <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-january-4-2026-n1313201\">telling NBC’s Kristen Welker on Sunday</a> that Trump “campaigned on Make America Great Again, that we thought was putting America first…‘America First’ actually means ‘for the American people.’ … They voted for this administration, and their small-dollar donation should matter. And MAGA has its own enemy list. And the enemies of the world are not on their enemy list, and they’re tired of being ignored.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead of making life more affordable for Americans, Trump doubled down on tariffs, allowed Obamacare subsidies to expire, and called affordability concerns a Democratic “<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-trump-says-the-word-affordability-is-a-con-job-by-the-democrats\">con job,</a>” —&nbsp;all betrayals of MAGA voters, Greene argues.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Trump was happy to implement&nbsp;cryptocurrency and AI policies that were friendly to billionaire donors and supporters, while allowing for more foreign student visas and obstructing the release of the Epstein files.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">To be sure, there are probably other deeper personal and strategic reasons for Greene’s break with Trump and retirement from politics for now. It is probably not a coincidence that this is happening as Trump’s approval ratings sink to their lowest levels of his second term, after Republicans faced off-year election losses and look likely to lose more next year, and as Trump’s MAGA coalition —&nbsp;at the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/today-explained-newsletter/471739/trump-maga-coalition-disarray-explained\">elite</a> and at the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473291/gen-z-volatile-young-trump-voters-conservative-democrat-liberal-vote\">popular</a> <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/472103/trump-coalition-2024-maga-collapse-support-popular-affordability-young-latino\">level</a> —&nbsp;seems to fracture and pick sides over the future of the GOP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But for all the fanfare of a year dominated by Trump and his movement, Greene’s reflections suggest that at least for one of its true believers, MAGA wasn’t as successful as it set out to be in its first year in office. And on top of that, she’s suggesting that there are voters who will care about this, are paying attention, and might not be forgiving in 2026 and beyond. It’s a clarion call for a movement she considered herself a founding member of, and one she thinks has been led astray.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Just last month, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/world/americas/trump-maduro-juan-orlando-hernandez.html\">Trump pardoned</a> a former Honduran president who’d been convicted of trafficking narcotics to the United States.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If this wasn’t about drugs, perhaps it was about democracy?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Secretary of State Marco Rubio argued Sunday that Maduro was “<a href=\"https://nypost.com/2026/01/04/us-news/marco-rubio-says-venezuelan-vp-delcy-rodriguez-isnt-a-legitimate-leader/\">an illegitimate president</a>,” since he had refused to accept his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2024/08/01/americas/venezuela-election-opposition-machado-hiding-intl-latam\">defeat in Venezuela’s 2024 election</a>. Only through Maduro’s ouster and “a period of transition and real elections” could Venezuelans achieve a legitimate “system of government,” Rubio said.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Yet Trump obviously has no principled objection to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/12/23/23522835/january-6-committee-report-takeaways\">incumbent presidents ignoring election results</a> they dislike. And Trump isn’t even pretending to care about Venezuelans’ democratic freedom.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In his press conference following Maduro’s capture, Trump:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>&nbsp;did not mention “democracy” once;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>&nbsp;argued that Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado lacked <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/trump-venezuelan-opposition-leader-respect-govern-after-maduro/story?id=128868550\">enough “respect within the country”</a> to take power;&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>and suggested Maduro’s handpicked vice president — Delcy Rodríguez — should be <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/world/americas/trump-venezuela-leader-rodriguez-machado.html\">allowed to remain in charge</a>, provided she complied with the White House’s demands.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But the Trump administration has floated another explanation for its act of war — one that is both crasser and, on its face, more plausible: The White House wanted US fossil fuel companies to <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/04/business/oil-us-companies-venezuela\">get a piece of Venezuela’s oil reserves</a>.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">Did the US just launch a “war for oil”?</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Speaking to the press Saturday, Trump announced that “very large United States oil companies” were going to fix Venezuela’s “badly broken oil infrastructure” and then start pumping “a tremendous amount of wealth out of the ground.” Some of this wealth would go to the Venezuelan people, in Trump’s telling, some to the US as “reimbursement” for Maduro’s crimes against America.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, Vance posted on X on Saturday that the American invasion was aimed in part at recovering “<a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447083909841398?s=20\">stolen oil</a>” — apparently referring to former Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez’s expropriation of fossil fuel assets owned by ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For many observers, this story rang true.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">After all, Trump is closely aligned <a href=\"https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/industry-detail/E01/2024\">with the fossil fuel sector</a>. And Venezuela has the world’s largest proven oil reserves. Trump routinely takes extreme measures to enrich <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/11/technology/ai-trump-executive-order.html\">allied industries</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Moreover, his peculiar approach to regime change in Venezuela — capturing Maduro but leaving his party in charge — makes sense, if his goal were merely to coerce Caracas into handing over its oil fields (as opposed to liberating its people).</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Many Democrats therefore declared that Trump’s invasion was a “<a href=\"https://x.com/RoKhanna/status/2007557654206656893\">war for oil</a>,” plain and simple. As US Rep. Pat Ryan of New York <a href=\"https://x.com/PatRyanUC/status/2007593645344731502\">put it</a>, “No matter what they say, it’s always oil.” In this framing, Trump risked American lives — and violated international law — just to advance the interests of Big Oil.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Alas, even this account of Trump’s actions doesn’t quite check out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Trump’s war doesn’t actually help America’s oil industry</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For much of the past century, the United States was heavily reliant on foreign oil, while US fossil fuel companies were ravenous for overseas reserves. Ensuring America’s access to the world’s fossil fuel wealth was therefore a core objective of its Middle East policy, particularly following the energy shocks of the 1970s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Given this reality, whenever the US intervened in a Middle Eastern conflict, many naturally assumed that its true motivation was resource extraction, not whatever pious rationale its presidents proclaimed. “No War for Oil” became a common slogan among American anti-war protesters during the George W. Bush era. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But over the past decade, the fracking revolution <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/06/the-impact-of-fracking-on-us-consumers-and-local-communities.html\">transformed America’s energy economy</a>. By learning how to crack rocks with fluid — and drill horizontally — US fossil fuel producers unlocked the vast oil and gas reserves trapped beneath America’s shale formations. By 2019, fracking had turned the United States into <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/america-is-more-energy-independent-than-ever-160020814.html\">a net exporter of energy</a> for the first time since the 1950s.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Today, America’s oil and gas sector isn’t hankering for more reserves so much as for higher prices. Since this time last year, oil prices have dropped by about 23 percent, due to a global glut of carbon energy. At a little over $57 a barrel, the price of crude is now below many fossil fuel firms’ breakeven prices. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And forecasters predict that 2026 will witness the <a href=\"https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20251105250/the-us-is-producing-record-amounts-of-oil-and-putting-profits-at-risk\">biggest global surplus of fossil fuel supply</a> on record.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In this context, Trump’s official plans for Venezuela’s oil sector would be a headache (if not a disaster) for most of America’s fossil fuel industry: Were Venezuela to drastically increase its oil exports, that would further depress global prices, potentially putting many embattled frackers out of business.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Of course, a few US firms might directly profit from revitalizing Venezuela&#8217;s energy industry. But even for these companies, Trump’s proposition isn’t especially attractive.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although Venezuela&#8217;s reserves are massive, its oil is mostly extra-heavy crude, which makes it more expensive to extract than America’s shale resources. Analysts estimate that increasing Venezuelan production by <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/03/business/venezuela-oil-industry-trump.html\">half a million barrels a day would take $10 billion in capital investment.</a> This isn’t an especially attractive proposition for ExxonMobil, particularly given Venezuela&#8217;s political instability.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of which is to say: American fossil fuel companies had little reason to lobby the Trump administration into overthrowing Maduro. And there is no publicly available evidence that they did so.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Trump wanted “a win”</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So: If Trump wasn’t acting at the behest of Big Oil, why <em>did</em> he topple Maduro?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president’s decision likely reflects a confluence of factors. And his <em>personal</em> attraction to Venezuela’s resource wealth could be among them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Although America’s oil lobby isn’t lusting after Venezuela’s reserves, Trump himself might be. For years, the president has criticized the United States for failing to “<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/trumps-take-the-oil-madness/\">take the oil</a>” of various Middle Eastern countries. And Trump also called for America to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/25/world/asia/afghanistan-trump-mineral-deposits.html\">expropriate Afghanistan’s mineral wealth</a>. In other words, he likes the general concept of pillaging conquered lands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Meanwhile, many in the GOP — including Rubio — have longed to overthrow Venezuela’s leftist regime for decades. For this reason, Trump’s advisers likely put military action against Maduro on his menu of foreign policy options.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump administration has also declared its intention to revive the Monroe Doctrine, which deems the Western Hemisphere the United States’s rightful sphere of influence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In concrete terms, this seems to entail deterring South American countries from forming alliances with Russia, China, or other powers hostile to the US. Trump suggested Saturday that Maduro’s capture <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/03/trump-venezela-mexico-00710063\">would aid that objective</a>, ensuring that “American dominance in the Western hemisphere will never be questioned again.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This said, pettier and more performative motives also seem to have informed Trump’s decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">According to the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2026/01/04/world/americas/trump-venezuela-leader-rodriguez-machado.html\">New York Times</a>, the White House offered Maduro the opportunity to go into “gilded exile in Turkey.” The Venezuelan leader rebuffed this offer, proceeding to dance on state television while a recording of his voice repeated “no crazy war.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s team reportedly felt that Maduro was mocking them, seemingly wagering that they didn’t have the gall to make good on their threats. So, the Times implies, the White House felt compelled to make him pay for his insolence.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, Trump was intent on “kicking off the year with a win,” according to an administration official who spoke with <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/national-security/2026/01/trump-nicolas-maduro-venezuela/685493/\">The Atlantic</a>. A separate White House insider told the magazine that Trump felt he needed a victory to counter “tough headlines” and “slumping poll numbers.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In a sense then, those accusing Trump of waging war to advance the interests of a major American industry may be giving him too much credit: His real objectives could actually be less rational and more superficial than that.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Whether on vacation or chilling at home, these images sent a message of heterosexual bliss, of contented couplehood. A world, as Joseph wrote, “where women’s online identities centered around the lives of their partners, a situation rarely seen reversed.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But then the boyfriends disappeared. You might see a hand, or a shadow, or the back of a head. But the faces of these men were cropped out or blurred out, “as if they want to erase the fact they exist without actually not posting them.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Women were living their lives, and their guys no longer served their personal brands.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Joseph puzzled this out in an article for Vogue called “<a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/is-having-a-boyfriend-embarrassing-now\">Is Having a Boyfriend Embarrassing Now?</a>” The piece went viral, sparking a wave of TikTok discourse and prompting <a href=\"https://www.vogue.com/article/on-the-reaction-to-is-having-a-boyfried-embarrassing-now\">a follow-up story</a> a couple of weeks later.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>Today, Explained</em> host Astead Herndon called Joseph up to talk about her piece, the reaction it received, and the state of heterosexual dating now.</p>\n<div class=\"megaphone-fm-embed\"><a href=\"https://megaphone.link/VMP9209630906\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">View Link</a></div>\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You wrote what I would think is one of the most memorable pieces of the year, a piece for Vogue that went viral in 2025, specifically about a question that you put into the zeitgeist. Can you tell me about the piece?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The piece was essentially asking this question if having a boyfriend has lost the social standing it once provided women. And I was analyzing this through the lens of social media.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I was looking at the way that women are very private about posting their romantic partners online. A lot of people were sticking emojis over their boyfriend&#8217;s heads. We&#8217;ve all seen this and I think it started to ramp up, and then it became a little bit of a parody where people would just edit out their boyfriend&#8217;s heads completely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But then I noticed that people would post their wedding videos or they would post their engagement videos and photos. They were edited in a way that you never knew what the husband looked like. And I was like, “Okay, this is feeling a bit extreme.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You&#8217;re noticing something that has really become clear on the timeline. I remember boyfriend reveals or things like that, but it&#8217;s gone to outright hiding. So what did your piece find and what did you even mean by “embarrassing”?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So I found basically three things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The first was, people said they didn&#8217;t want to do this simply for privacy reasons. And I questioned, “Well, why is it only this area of your life?” And then they would go on to say, “Well, if I posted my boyfriend and he cheated on me next week and I had to go back and delete the pictures…I&#8217;d have to deal with the shame of that.” </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But then there were women who just outright thought the idea of having a boyfriend was inherently embarrassing because it didn&#8217;t align with the brand. A lot of people felt like “if I post my boyfriend on Instagram or on social media, I&#8217;m indicating something about me to the world that I don&#8217;t want people to know.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the piece, one of the comments that I quote is this idea of someone saying, “Why does having a boyfriend feel Republican?” I think it&#8217;s the way that the heterosexual romantic relationship has almost been co-opted a little bit by the right. It feels traditionally very conservative. I feel like I&#8217;m aligning to this idea of the world that doesn&#8217;t really feel natural to me.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>I was going to ask specifically about how we should think about this alongside rising trends like “tradwives” and others. Are these things that are happening at the same time? Are these just different communities?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think they are happening at the same time. I think about the reaction to my piece — whether it&#8217;s from the men who were just really angry that I could ever talk disparagingly about men or the women who were very proud of their relationships — feeling as if [it] was an attack on them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think the way we talk about relationships online has changed so much. I was talking about the ReesaTeesa “<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@reesamteesa/video/7335420025240554782?lang=en\">Who the fuck did I marry?</a>” [series] or the “<a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/2025/11/24/danish-deception-summary-tiktok-onyeka-ehie/87447987007/\">Danish Deception</a>,” these women coming online making these 60-part TikTok videos, detailing all of the horrible things that have happened to them.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@dailymirror/video/7055687893817330950?q=West%20Elm%20Caleb&amp;t=1767127252028\"><strong>West Elm Caleb</strong></a><strong>.<em> </em>I remember that one.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">All of these things. So there is no illusion around the fantasy anymore. And so I think that has gripped a lot of people.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>You did a call-out on your Instagram, and the responses from followers said that there was “an overwhelming sense…that regardless of the relationship, being with a man was almost a guilty thing to do.” So are we talking here just about, like, shame of heterosexuality partnerships? It seems like straightness is at the core of this.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Oh yeah, 100 percent. And I think this is what really upset people as well. We don&#8217;t talk about heterosexuality in this way. We very much see it as a norm. This is just the way to be in society. And so we should never really question what&#8217;s going on here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But actually, I was like, no, it&#8217;s deeper than that. So one of the inspirations behind this piece was a book by professor Jane Ward. Her book is called <a href=\"https://nyupress.org/9781479851553/the-tragedy-of-heterosexuality/\"><em>The Tragedy of Heterosexuality</em></a>, and in the book, she has a chapter that is dedicated to the things that queer people say behind their straight friends’ backs. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And it was absolutely fascinating to get into the perception of straightness, straight people, and straight culture. And I think the idea of embarrassment definitely came from reading that and really realizing the ways that, yeah, straight culture is very embarrassing.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What do you think we&#8217;ve learned about straight relationships from this episode?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">I think what I&#8217;ve learned is that people are still trying to claim the privilege that being in a relationship, particularly a straight relationship, gives them. And I think for some people, their anger to this piece was about them realizing that they might lose this privilege, and they might not have many other privileges. And so losing this feels like a big deal.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>Do you feel like you&#8217;ve come through this thinking boyfriends are more or less embarrassing?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Do you know what? I think I&#8217;ve come away thinking that they&#8217;re more embarrassing. I can&#8217;t lie because the men are being embarrassing, and the women with boyfriends upset about this piece are even more embarrassing. So I&#8217;m like, damn, I might have to double down.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

According to President Donald Trump, <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/473935/trump-venezuela-attack-maduro-arrest-criminal-charges-what-to-know\">Maduro was seized in a late night military operation</a> and transferred to a US naval vessel to be transported to New York to face charges related to drug trafficking and narco-terrorism. The operation reportedly included large-scale military strikes, marking the most direct intervention to date.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While Maduro is now out of power, the political future of Venezuela remains uncertain.

After a dramatic late-night Delta Force raid on his safe house in Venezuela, he and his wife are now on board the USS Iwo Jima, headed to New York, where they will <a href=\"https://x.com/AGPamBondi/status/2007428087143686611\">face charges of drug trafficking and narco-terrorism</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But as for what’s happening in Venezuela itself, the situation is still fluid, and <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/live/\">a press conference</a> held on Saturday afternoon by President Donald Trump and his top national security officials raised as many questions as it answered, though it did underline some core themes of this administration&#8217;s foreign policy.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump said multiple times that for the foreseeable future, the US would be “running” Venezuela. In particular, he said it would largely be run by “the people that are standing right behind me” on stage at Mar-a-Lago, a group that included Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, Joint Chiefs Chair Gen. Daniel Caine, and homeland security adviser Stephen Miller.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Trump was vague about what “running” Venezuela actually means and did not seem to indicate that US officials would be taking direct power in Caracas. He noted that the vice president of Venezuela, Delcy Rodríguez, had been sworn in, claimed that Rubio had spoken with her, and that&nbsp; “she&#8217;s essentially willing to do what we think is necessary to make Venezuela great again.” (In her own first statements, Rodríguez <a href=\"https://elpais.com/internacional/2026-01-03/ultima-hora-de-las-explosiones-en-venezuela-en-directo.html?ssm=TW_CM&amp;utm_source=tw&amp;utm_medium=social\">called for</a> Maduro’s return and vowed that Venezuela would not be a US “colony,” so it’s not quite clear what assurances she gave Rubio.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This would seem to indicate that the administration is willing to leave Rodríguez or other top regime figures in power, at least for the time being, <a href=\"https://x.com/GregGrandin/status/2007409276588110075\">which jibes with what some lawmakers claim </a>they’ve heard from the administration but not with what most people would consider “running” the country.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump said that US military forces in the region would remain in place and that he “retains all military options until United States demands have been fully met and fully satisfied,” including a much larger second strike, but did not precisely spell out what those demands were.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One topic he did dwell on was oil. Venezuela has the world’s largest oil reserves, though production has lagged in recent years as the country’s infrastructure has deteriorated.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Oil wasn’t a major part of the administration&#8217;s rationale for military action (which focused much more heavily on drug trafficking) until mid-December, when Trump and Miller began publicly accusing the Venezuelan <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/venezuela-trumps-shifting-explanations-military-buildup/story?id=128864481\">regime of having stolen American oil resources</a>. (Maduro’s mentor and predecessor, Hugo Chavez, completed the state takeover of Venezuela’s oil industry, including several American projects, but <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/12/20/venezuela-oil-nationalization-expropriation/\">most of the takeover actually happened in the 1970s</a> under a democratically elected government.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Asked about an ongoing American presence in Venezuela, Trump said, &#8220;we&#8217;re going to have a presence in Venezuela as it pertains to oil. We are sending our expertise. … We&#8217;re going to be taking out a tremendous amount of wealth, out of the ground.&#8221; He went so far as to suggest the US could sell this oil to other countries, including China and Russia — Venezuela’s current security partners.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Notably not mentioned was “democracy” or a demand for new elections.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Venezuelan opposition, led by recent Nobel Peace Prize winner María Corina Machado has, for months, been cheering on the Trump administration’s actions on Venezuela, but Trump was dismissive of her on Saturday, saying they had not been in contact and describing her as a “nice woman” who “doesn&#8217;t have the support within, or the respect within the country” to take over.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Machado had issued a statement earlier in the day, praising the US for having “fulfilled its promise to uphold the rule of law” and calling for Edmundo Gonzalez, <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cd1d10453zno\">considered by the US </a>and many other governments to have been the rightful winner of the 2024 Venezuelan election, to be immediately sworn in as president. Trump made no mention of Gonzalez.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“It’s clear this wasn&#8217;t motivated by deep concern for bringing democracy to Venezuela, or assisting the Venezuelan people or creating an alternative governance structure,” Michael Shifter, an adjunct professor of Latin American studies at Georgetown University, told Vox. “It was really just aimed at Maduro.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The situation is still fluid and much may still be unknown even by the key decision-makers, but if we take Trump purely at his word, we appear to have a situation in which the current government of Venezuela will be left in place — minus Maduro — in exchange for oil concessions to the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\">What does this tell us about Trump’s foreign policy?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump made several references to the Monroe (or “Don-roe,” as he’s updated it) Doctrine and asserting&nbsp; “American dominance in the Western Hemisphere,” a theme also underlined in his recently released <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/471443/trump-national-security-strategy-europe\">national security strategy</a>. He suggested that action against the left-wing governments of Colombia and Cuba is still a possibility. And he criticized previous presidents for ignoring growing problems in the hemisphere as they “fought wars that were 10,000 miles away.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">On the other hand, Maduro’s ouster caps a week in which Trump <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/467256/trump-nigeria-christians-intervention-military\">ordered airstrikes in Nigeria</a> over the persecution of Christians and <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/trump-threatens-iran-over-protest-deaths-unrest-flares-2026-01-02/\">threatened them in Iran</a> over the killing of protesters. Trump clearly sees the US as more than just a regional power.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Conservative foreign policy “restrainers” were hopeful when he took office that Trump would usher in an era of <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/386680/trump-foreign-policy-rubio-hegseth-waltz-gabbard\">more judicious use of military force</a>. Clearly, Trump is not averse to military action, in the Western Hemisphere, the Middle East, or anywhere else. But he prefers these actions to be quick and decisive, with <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/world-politics/459513/trump-globalist-foreign-policy\">limited goals and adversaries</a> with little capacity to retaliate. The capture of Maduro was a textbook example. “He f’d around and he found out,” as Hegseth put it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A full-fledged regime change operation could risk plunging the country into chaos and drawing the US military into a quagmire. <a href=\"https://www.compactmag.com/article/intervention-leads-to-immigration/\">Immigration restrictionists were worried</a> that it would (ironically, given the administration behind it) trigger a new wave of migration from the country that is already the source of one of the world’s largest refugee populations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Regime collapse might still be in the cards, given the precarious state of the Venezuelan state and the numerous senior leaders and armed groups that may vie for power in Maduro’s absence.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump may have brushed aside comparisons to previous US interventions in Latin America, claiming those were simply done under incompetent presidents, but the echoes of past US actions are likely to reverberate in the region.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“The history of US military intervention in Latin America has not been a happy one,” Shifter said. “And while I think there’s no sympathy or solidarity with Maduro, per se, I think [other governments are] asking, ‘If Trump could do this, why can&#8217;t he do it to us?’”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Certainly, the administration is not acting as if there are constraints on the president’s ability to use military force. US officials have <a href=\"https://x.com/JDVance/status/2007447388697268441\">made the case</a> that the operation was not “illegal” because of the indictments against Maduro and the illegitimacy of his rule, though neither would supersede the UN Charter’s prohibition on the use of military force against another country’s sovereignty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">True, the US carried out a similar operation to capture Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega in 1990 (Noriega surrendered 36 years ago to the day, in fact), but that operation was similarlycriticized and <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-12-30-mn-956-story.html\">condemned by the UN General Assembly</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The capture of Maduro also shows the ongoing blurring of law enforcement and military functions under this administration — not only did FBI agents participate in the raid, but Trump, during his press conference, consistently digressed from Venezuela to the recent troop deployments in Washington, DC, Memphis, and other cities, which he portrayed as part of the same overarching project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Will voters buy it? Just 25 percent of voters and about half of Republicans supported military action in a <a href=\"https://poll.qu.edu/poll-release?releaseid=3943\">December poll</a>. MAGA defector <a href=\"https://x.com/repmtg/status/2007485346913607836?s=46\">Marjorie Taylor Greene</a> noted correctly on Saturday that, despite Trump’s claim to have prevented tens of thousands of drug deaths with his Venezuela campaign, the vast majority of these deaths are caused by fentanyl, which does not come from Venezuela. (The alleged Venezuelan drug boats were probably carrying cocaine, primarily for the European market.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump’s bona fides as a drug warrior <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/471003/trump-honduras-hernandez-asfura-nasralla\">were also undermined by his recent pardon</a> of a Honduran president convicted of a much more active role in trafficking in the very New York court where Maduro is likely to be tried.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In short, it will be difficult for the administration to push back against the most cynical interpretations of its motives, and it’s not clear they’re even trying. In the George W. Bush era, it was anti-war protesters accusing the US of going to war for oil. In the Trump era, it’s the president saying it.&nbsp;</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The attack is a major escalation in Trump’s months-long pressure campaign against Venezuela and pushes the US into uncertain territory legally, politically, and militarily. Here’s what we know.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What just happened?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">US forces launched attacks against an unspecified number of targets in Caracas, Venezuela, overnight, and successfully located and captured Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The couple has since been flown out of the country, Trump said in an <a href=\"https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/115830428767897167\">early morning social media post</a>, and will be taken by ship to face criminal charges in the US. Much is still unclear, but Trump said Saturday that no US troops were killed in the attack.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maduro has been under indictment in the US since March 2020, when the Southern District of New York <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2020/03/26/nicolas-maduro-drug-trafficking-trump-venezuela\">charged him with narco-terrorism, drug trafficking, and corruption</a>, along with 14 others. On Saturday, the Justice Department <a href=\"https://www.justice.gov/opa/media/1422326/dl\">unsealed a new superseding indictment</a> that brought additional charges against Maduro and also charged Flores and other members of Maduro’s family, and FBI agents <a href=\"https://x.com/ZcohenCNN/status/2007449914226225253?s=20\">reportedly worked with US special forces</a> to detain Maduro; the chair of the Joint Chiefs, Gen. Dan Caine, described it on Saturday as an “unprecedented operation” conducted “in unison with our intelligence agency partners and law enforcement teammates.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Under Trump, the US has also described Maduro as the head of a cartel called Cartel de los Soles, which it designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization in November. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/470286/terrorism-maduro-venezuela-antifa\">As my colleague Josh Keating has explained, though</a>, that designation stretches the definitions of both “terrorist” and “organization”: “Cartel de los Soles” is a term used in Venezuela to refer generally to criminality by government and military officials in Venezuela, but not any one unified organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What’s the context?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the culmination, for now, of a US military effort that began with US strikes on alleged drug boats this September. The strikes, which are believed to have killed <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2026/01/03/us-venezuela-strikes-trump-maduro/#link-P33OZO7KTZHZZO752Q3OGINIJQ\">at least 115 people</a>, targeted alleged drug traffickers in the Caribbean and Pacific, including those affiliated with the Venezuelan cartel Tren de Aragua.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time as those strikes were ongoing, the US staged a substantial military buildup in the Caribbean — far more than would be needed for relatively limited anti-drug operations, including dispatching the USS Gerald Ford aircraft carrier group, B-52 bombers, and <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/16/special-operations-helicopters-venezuela/\">special operations helicopters</a> generally used for ground operations. Trump also authorized the CIA to take covert action within Venezuela, and the US further stepped up its anti-regime efforts in December with the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-tanker-seized-venezuela-maduro-0a148ba01684fc6ce1a228dd276732c0\">seizure of an oil tanker</a> off the coast of Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">However, Trump’s relationship to Venezuela substantially predates tensions this summer: Early in 2025, he attempted to invoke the Alien Enemies Act against Tren de Aragua, threatened tariffs on countries buying oil or gas from Venezuela, and canceled (and then <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/world/americas/trump-administration-greenlights-chevron-to-resume-pumping-oil-in-venezuela-0353262b\">renewed</a>) an oil export license allowing Chevron to operate in Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">More significantly, Trump has threatened military action in Venezuela long before this year. Early in his first term, in response to a 2017 crackdown on pro-democracy protests in Venezuela, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/12/world/americas/trump-venezuela-military.html\">he warned</a> that “We have many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary.” Around that time, he also reportedly asked advisers about <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2018/07/04/politics/donald-trump-venezuela-invasion\">options for invading the country</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">That experience set the tone for the rest of his first-term policy toward Venezuela, including a US-led effort to recognize Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaidó as Venezuela’s legitimate president and force out Maduro, which ultimately collapsed. Now, more than eight years after his first threat of military force, Trump has pulled the metaphorical trigger.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is this a regime-change operation?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s too early to say for sure, but it’s starting to sound like one.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For now, while Maduro himself has been removed, his vice president, Delcy Rodríguez, is still in place, as is the rest of the Maduro government. Trump, however, repeatedly said in a Saturday press conference that the US intends to “run the country until such time as we can do a safe, proper and judicious transition” — presumably to a more US-friendly government.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In the same address, Trump also indicated US oil interests in Venezuela were a consideration, and warned that more US action could be forthcoming: “We&#8217;re going to run [the country], essentially, until such time as a proper transition can take place. As everyone knows, the oil business in Venezuela has been a bust,” he said. “We&#8217;re going to have our very large United States oil companies, the biggest anywhere in the world, go in, spend billions of dollars, fix the badly broken infrastructure, the oil infrastructure, and start making money for the country. And we are ready to stage a second and much larger attack if we need to do so.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Venezuelan opposition leader and recent Nobel Peace Prize laureate María Corina Machado also sounded a similar note on Saturday, <a href=\"https://x.com/MariaCorinaYA/status/2007473689583829046?s=20\">releasing a statement</a> titled “The hour of freedom has arrived.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If so, however, what such an operation would look like is extremely unclear. The US history of regime change efforts, both in Latin America and more recently in the Middle East, is fraught, to say the least. And despite Machado’s anti-Maduro activism, there’s no clear government-in-waiting that the Trump administration could help into power: Trump told reporters Saturday that “I think it would be very tough for [Machado] to be the leader. She doesn&#8217;t have the support within or the respect within the country.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Lastly, it’s still possible the Trump administration simply won’t follow through: As of Saturday, there was no evidence of a sustained US presence in Venezuela itself, though the US military buildup in the Caribbean is still in place.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

Since the fall, the US has been <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/471075/trump-hegseth-strike-venezuela-drug-boats-war\">striking alleged drug boats</a>. On December 30, the US government announced that the CIA had <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/12/29/us/politics/cia-drone-strike-venezuela.html\">conducted a drone strike</a> inside Venezuela.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Much is still unknown about Saturday’s military operation, the future of Venezuela, and what the US might do next in the region. But understanding what might happen next starts with how the situation escalated to this point.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s America’s problem with Venezuela?&nbsp;</h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Venezuela’s socialist regime has been a thorn in the side of US presidential administrations since the days of Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez, who first took power in 1999. Venezuela has opposed US influence in Latin America, and allied itself with US adversaries like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and numerous militant groups opposed to US policy. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since 2013, when Chavez died and Maduro succeeded him, Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy has been in a tailspin, with hyperinflation and mass unemployment. Organized crime and corruption are rampant, the government has cracked down on opposition parties and civil society, and Venezuelans have become the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/465074/venezuela-trump-maduro-regime-change-drug-boats\">world’s largest refugee population</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Most relevant for the current crisis, Venezuela has also become a major trans-shipment point for Andean cocaine bound for the US, West Africa, and Europe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During Trump’s first term as president, his administration took a variety of actions — overt and covert — to pressure Maduro to leave office. When he returned to office in 2025, Trump initially looked like he was going to try to have a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-maduro-envoy-migrants-grenell-edfa58920c0a76f0bbe9de995a07d1a3\">more productive relationship</a> with Maduro, seeking deals on detained US citizens, refugee returns, and access for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-us-oil.html\">US firms to Venezuela’s oil fields</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Trump soon put a stop to those early talks and dialed up the pressure on Maduro to leave. This was likely at least partly driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a longtime outspoken Maduro critic since his days in the Senate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US considers Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/470286/terrorism-maduro-venezuela-antifa\">be the head of a “narcoterrorist cartel.”</a> Maduro’s regime is undoubtedly corrupt and autocratic, but not all the US allegations hold up. The administration accuses Maduro of intentionally flooding the US with drugs and criminals, and of effectively controlling prison gangs like Tren de Aragua.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While the Venezuelan government has well-documented ties to crime, Maduro is almost certainly not personally directing drug shipments. Meanwhile, Tren de Aragua, a fixation of Trump’s dating back to his presidential campaign, is almost certainly not involved in transnational trafficking. Trump has also suggested, misleadingly, that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/us/politics/trump-venezuela-fentanyl.html\">Venezuela is tied to fentanyl production</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, different players in the Trump administration may be interested in Venezuela for different reasons, but as an emblematic country for migration, drug trafficking, and socialism, it sits within the Venn diagram of the administration’s priorities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, January 3, 10:40 am: </strong>This story originally misstated the year Hugo Chavez came to power; it was 1999.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

The gyms are suddenly crowded; the freshly bought journals are pristine; and suddenly, everyone you know is trying to learn Italian like they’re about to become a deep-cover spy in Tuscany. It’s the new year, new you, new everything.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Or, at least, it is for a few days. January 9, the second Friday of the month this year, is <a href=\"https://bestlifeonline.com/date-new-years-resolution-is-likely-to-fail/#:~:text=Yet%20by%20mid%2Dmonth%2C%20that,extent%20of%20our%20collective%20quitting.\">colloquially known as “Quitter’s Day,”</a> because it’s the date nearly half of all people abandon their New Year’s resolutions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">It’s enough to make you wonder why we bother in the first place. But the New Year is one of the few moments when our culture collectively agrees that it’s normal to try to change. Behavioral scientists even have a name for it: the “<a href=\"https://faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Dai_Fresh_Start_2014_Mgmt_Sci.pdf\">fresh start effect</a>,” the idea that temporal landmarks — a new year, a birthday, a Monday — can make people feel like they’re opening a new chapter, which can translate into change.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The opportunity to change —&nbsp;whether it’s a change of habits, change of skills, or change of communities, or even far bigger changes like changing careers or religion&nbsp;—&nbsp;is really a modern privilege. Even today, not everyone has that freedom, and no one has it equally, but for a huge slice of the people reading this story, our range of plausible life trajectories is far wider than it was for the vast bulk of human history, when life paths were far more limited and largely fixed at birth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, this New Year’s, let’s ignore the cynics and embrace the freedom to change. To help you along, I’ve gathered five evidence-based tactics designed to help your resolutions survive contact with real life and to help you take advantage of your historically unusual ability to chart your own life.</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tip 1: Lower those standards (and get specific)</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Why do most resolutions fail? Because they’re vibes, not actual behavior. “Get in shape.” “Be healthier.” “Write more.” Those aren’t actions; they’re <a href=\"https://med.stanford.edu/content/dam/sm/s-spire/documents/PD.locke-and-latham-retrospective_Paper.pdf\">umbrella identities with disputed borders</a>, which means every day trying to live up to them in all their vague glory becomes an enervating negotiation. How much “more” counts as “writing more”? Exactly what shape are you trying to get into, and how many edges can it have?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So, instead, <a href=\"https://www.decisionskills.com/uploads/5/1/6/0/5160560/doran_1981_s.m.a.r.t-way-management-review.pdf\">make the goal so small — but so specific</a> — that it can’t be argued. Ten minutes of meditation, two pages of journaling, one lap around the park, one email to that friend you haven’t seen in too long. The aim here is not to transform overnight; it’s to get you repeating a behavior.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Here’s a quick test: If you can’t describe your habit in one sentence that includes the all-important words <em>when</em> and <em>where</em>, it’s not ready yet. If this feels like lowering your standards, that’s okay. What you’re trying to do is lower the threshold for action, so you can build up from a solid foundation. </p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tip 2: Attach the habit to a consistent cue — not your mood</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A resolution powered by motivation is basically a weather-dependent infrastructure plan. Sometimes that’s literal (“it’s too cold to get that run in”) and sometimes it’s psychological (“I’m too down to get that run in”). If you’re waiting to <em>feel motivated</em>, you’re betting your habit on the <a href=\"https://www.behaviormodel.org/\">one ingredient you control the least</a> — whereas you can almost always increase “ability” by shrinking the task (see tip No. 1), and you can engineer the “prompt” by tying it to a stable cue.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So try this format:</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>After I [existing routine], I will [tiny habit].</strong></p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>After I start the coffee, I will do five squats.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>After I sit at my desk, I will write one sentence.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>After I brush my teeth, I will floss one tooth. (Yes, one. I’m serious about lowering standards.)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pick an anchor that’s mechanical and reliable — coffee brewing, shower ending, laptop opening — not something fuzzy like “after dinner,” which changes shape depending on how chaotic your day is. The key is to <a href=\"https://www.metalearn.net/content/files/docs/How-20Habits-20are-20Formed.pdf\">contextualize your habits</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tip 3: Write 2 “if-then” plans for the messiest parts of your week</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What’s the biggest difference between disciplined and undisciplined people? Undisciplined people count on discipline; disciplined people count on plans.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">What psychologists <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/chapter/bookseries/abs/pii/S0065260106380021\">call implementation intentions</a> — “If X happens, then I will do Y” — can help reinforce habits because they essentially act as pre-decisions. Instead of relying on non-renewable willpower (see tip No. 2), you decide in advance what you’ll do when a reliable cue appears — or just as important, if a reliable problem pops up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Write two if-then plans in advance:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>The time problem:</strong><strong><br></strong>“If I don’t have time for the full version, then I will do the 2-minute version.”</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>The mood problem:</strong><strong><br></strong>“If I feel resistant/tired/annoyed, then I will do the start ritual (shoes on, doc open, water bottle filled) and stop after two minutes if I still want to.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The point here is to limit the pressure you’re putting on your future self — who, after all, is the poor guy who has to fulfill all these resolutions — by <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.565202/full\">planning ahead for what could go wrong</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tip 4: Track 1 tiny metric and recruit 1 person</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A goal that lives only in your head is easy to renegotiate at 11:47 pm. Two simple ways to resist that temptation are feedback and accountability.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Self-monitoring shows up again and again as a core component of successful behavior change programs, with <a href=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3268700/\">research demonstrating</a> that more frequent tracking is consistently associated with better outcomes. This does not mean you have to become a quantified-self maximalist, though admittedly, I’m writing as someone who gets three separate sleep scores each night. But you do need a way to make the desired behavior visible.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Pick one metric you can record in under 30 seconds:</p>\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>Did I do the habit today? (Y/N)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Minutes spent</li>\n\n\n\n<li>One number (steps, pages, dollars saved)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But, the real secret sauce of accountability is when you add in additional eyes. So enlist a witness:</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“Hey — I’m doing X for January. Can I text you a ✅ when I do it? No need to respond.” (Just don’t send this text at 11:47 pm.)</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This is the modern, low-touch version of a <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41366-024-01468-9\">very old technology to encourage good habits</a>: regular meetings and structured belonging.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Tip 5: For the big swing, prototype the change before you leap</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Let’s end by going to the other side of the resolution spectrum: the big stuff — new career direction, a move to a different city, a spiritual shift. The common mistake is treating such massive changes as a binary, irreversible decision, which can cause you to <a href=\"https://homepages.se.edu/cvonbergen/files/2013/01/The-Psychology-of-Doing-Nothing_Forms-of-Decision-Avoidance-Result-from-Reason-and-Emotion.pdf\">freeze under the uncertainty</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Instead of thinking you have no choice but to stay or go, <a href=\"https://www.insead.edu/faculty-research/publications/journal-articles/how-stay-stuck-wrong-career\">run a pilot</a> — a time-boxed, reversible experiment that lets you <em>try the change at a smaller scale</em> before you reorganize your whole life around it. The point isn’t to “prove” you’ll succeed; it’s to collect real information. What does this path actually feel like on a Tuesday? What obstacles show up? Do you get energy from it, or do you mostly dread it? Does it create momentum, or does it drain you?</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Break it into four parts:</p>\n\n<ol class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li><strong>A clear question.</strong> What are you testing: interest, fit, feasibility, or logistics?<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A tight time box.</strong> Two weeks for a tiny test, six weeks for something meaningful, 12 weeks for big change.<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A minimum viable version of the change.</strong> Don’t think “switch careers,” but “do one small project in that field and talk to five people who do it.”<br></li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>A decision rule.</strong> What evidence would make you expand, pivot, or stop? (If you don’t set this in advance, you’ll interpret every feeling as a sign from the universe. Which, maybe it is&nbsp;— but good luck knowing for sure.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The point of all this is to make change less moralistic and more mechanical. You <a href=\"https://lifedesignlab.stanford.edu/dyl\">design a better default</a>, then practice it until it feels like you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">If you’re lucky enough to have some real freedom — the ability to choose new habits, new skills, maybe even a new path — that is itself a kind of progress worth recognizing. This New Year can just be the one where you cash in that psychological coupon gifted by many centuries of progress and build the kind of change that lasts through Quitter’s Day and well beyond.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em>A version of this story originally appeared in the Good News newsletter.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/pages/good-news-newsletter-signup\">Sign up here!</a></em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

As a socialist regime that is a major source of migrants and has ties to drug trafficking, it’s on the Trump administration’s radar for several reasons.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"wp-block-list\">\n<li>An Iraq-style ground invasion and occupation is very unlikely, but a military campaign against Venezuela could involve airstrikes and raids targeting Venezuela’s drug cartels — or potentially the government itself.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since the early fall, the US has been building up its military forces in the Caribbean and launching airstrikes on alleged drug boats, fueling speculation that it is planning a major military operation against the government of Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">This week, the situation escalated dramatically with the US <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-administration-seizes-oil-tanker-off-venezuela-coast-us-officials-say-2025-12-10/?oref=d_brief_nl&amp;utm_source=Sailthru&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=The%20D%20Brief:%20December%2011%2C%202025&amp;utm_term=newsletter_d1_dbrief\">seizing a sanctioned oil tanker</a> off the Venezuelan coast. “Other things are happening,” commented President Donald Trump, who has been calling for Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro to step down. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has said <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/trump-says-us-will-very-soon-begin-stopping-suspected-venezuelan-drug-2025-11-27/\">that the US will “very soon”</a> begin taking action against suspected Venezuelan drug traffickers on land. Given that the US considers Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro to <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/470286/terrorism-maduro-venezuela-antifa\">be the head of a “narcoterrorist cartel,”</a> this could very well include action against the Venezuelan government and military.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump recently spoke by phone with Maduro and, <a href=\"https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/world/americas/venezuela/article313261442.html\">according to the Miami Herald</a>, told him he could save himself and his family by giving up power and leaving the country. Over the past few weeks, lawmakers have also been investigating claims that Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth authorized a second strike to kill survivors of an initial attack on a suspected drug boat on September 2, an action <a href=\"https://www.execfunctions.org/p/a-dishonorable-strike?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">legal experts say could be considered murder</a> under the laws of armed conflict.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump has not yet committed to military action, but has said he believes Maduro’s “days are numbered.” It’s been a strange sort of march to war, in which some of the justifications simply don’t make much sense and the ultimate goal of the operation isn’t always clear. But how did we get here? And where might this all be headed?&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What has the US military been up to in the Caribbean?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US carried out its first strike against an <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/02/politics/us-military-strike-caribbean\">alleged drug boat </a>on September 2 in the Caribbean between Venezuela and Trinidad and Tobago. Since then, <a href=\"https://adamisacson.com/boat-strikes/\">20 more boats have been destroyed</a> in the Caribbean and Eastern Pacific, killing more than 80 people, in what Hegseth has dubbed Operation Southern Spear.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the same time, the US has been carrying out the largest military buildup in the Caribbean since the Cuban Missile Crisis, including thousands of troops, advanced drones, fighter jets, guided missile destroyers and cruisers, and — most dramatically — the aircraft carrier <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/uss-ford-arrives-caribbean-will-it-strike-or-stand-down\">USS Gerald Ford</a> and its strike group. Special Operations helicopters <a href=\"https://www.military.com/daily-news/2025/12/10/us-military-flies-2-fighter-jets-over-gulf-of-venezuela-scrutiny-grows.html\">as well as fighter jets</a> have been flying missions less than a hundred miles <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/10/16/special-operations-helicopters-venezuela/\">from the Venezuelan coast</a>. Trump has also authorized covert action <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/15/us/politics/trump-covert-cia-action-venezuela.html?partner=slack&amp;smid=sl-share\">by the CIA within Venezuela</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Though Trump has not sought congressional authorization for military action (and is unlikely to do so), the White House appeared to be making a case for action by <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/470286/terrorism-maduro-venezuela-antifa\">designating Venezuela’s “Cartel de los Soles” as a terrorist organization</a> and identifying Maduro as its leader. Cartel de los Soles is not, strictly speaking, a cartel. It’s a term used by Venezuelans for senior political and military leaders in Venezuela who are involved in a range of criminal activities, including drug trafficking. In other words, by the Trump administration’s logic, the Venezuelan state is itself a terrorist organization.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is the US about to go to war with Venezuela?</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">At the very least, the administration wants it to look that way. The US currently has way more firepower in the Caribbean than it needs if the plan is to simply continue blowing up boats, and an aircraft carrier is not particularly suited to a counternarcotics mission — it is well-suited for an air campaign targeting Venezuela, however.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Experts at the <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/uss-ford-arrives-caribbean-will-it-strike-or-stand-down\">Center for Strategic and International Studies</a> (CSIS) point out that the Ford is a “use it or lose it” asset — only about a third of America’s 11 aircraft carriers are at sea at any given time and demand for them is high in hot zones like the Middle East and Indo-Pacific. If the Trump administration wants to do something with all the firepower it has built up, the clock is ticking.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">In some ways, the uncertainty surrounding the situation is analogous to the days prior to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, when many political experts believed a war made little sense from Russia’s perspective, but the amount of military hardware being assembled was simply too much to deny.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The seizure of the oil tanker marks an escalation, targeting the Venezuelan state’s energy revenue rather than an alleged drug boat. But there’s still a possibility that things could deescalate quickly. An instructive precedent here might be the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-logoff-newsletter-trump/411864/trump-houthis-yemen-ceasefire-red-sea-shipping\">US air campaign against Yemen’s Houthi rebels</a>, which ended with a ceasefire last spring when the Houthis agreed to stop targeting US ships — but continued firing at other ships as well as Israel. Trump has shown on this and other occasions he is willing to cut a military campaign short before it risks turning into a quagmire.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Why is this happening? What’s America’s problem with Venezuela?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Venezuela’s socialist regime has been a thorn in Washington’s side since the days of Maduro’s predecessor Hugo Chavez, who first took power in 1999. Venezuela has opposed US influence in Latin America, and allied itself with US adversaries like Cuba, Iran, Russia, and numerous militant groups opposed to US policy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since 2013, when Chavez died and Maduro succeeded him, Venezuela’s oil-dependent economy has been in a tailspin, with hyperinflation and mass unemployment. Organized crime and corruption is rampant, the government has cracked down on opposition parties and civil society, and Venezuelans have become the <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/politics/465074/venezuela-trump-maduro-regime-change-drug-boats\">world’s largest refugee population</a>. Most relevant for the current crisis, Venezuela has also become a major transshipment point for Andean cocaine bound for the US, West Africa, and Europe.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">During Trump’s first term as president, his administration took a variety of actions — overt and covert — to pressure Maduro to leave office. When he returned to office this year, Trump initially looked like he was going to try to have a <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/trump-maduro-envoy-migrants-grenell-edfa58920c0a76f0bbe9de995a07d1a3\">more productive relationship</a> with Maduro, seeking deals on detained US citizens, refugee returns, and access for <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/10/world/americas/maduro-venezuela-us-oil.html\">US firms to Venezuela’s oil fields</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But Trump has now put a stop to those early talks and dialed up the pressure on Maduro to leave. This is likely at least partly driven by Secretary of State Marco Rubio, a longtime outspoken Maduro critic since his days in the Senate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Maduro’s regime is undoubtedly corrupt and autocratic, but not all the US allegations hold up. The administration accuses Maduro of intentionally flooding the US with drugs and criminals, and of effectively controlling prison gangs like Tren de Aragua. While the Venezuelan government has well-documented ties to crime, Maduro is almost certainly not personally directing drug shipments. Meanwhile, Tren de Aragua, a fixation of Trump’s dating back to his presidential campaign, is almost certainly not involved in transnational trafficking. Trump has also suggested, misleadingly, that <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/19/us/politics/trump-venezuela-fentanyl.html\">Venezuela is tied to fentanyl production</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Ultimately, different players in the Trump administration may be interested in Venezuela for different reasons, but as an emblematic country for migration, drug trafficking, and socialism, it sits within the Venn diagram of the administration’s priorities.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>What could this military operation look like?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">One thing we should probably not expect is an Iraq-style invasion and occupation of Venezuela.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">For the moment, the US simply does not have enough ground troops in the region for that. “Invasion is not an option,” Mark Cancian, a former Marine Corps colonel and senior adviser at CSIS, told Vox. Much more likely, in Cancian’s view, is an air campaign, primarily conducted with missiles fired by ships and aircraft outside the range of Venezuela’s Russian-provided air defense systems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Since Venezuela is primarily a transshipment point for drugs rather than a producer, there’s actually less infrastructure to attack than in some other countries, but the US could still strike drug labs, airstrips used by traffickers, or the camps belonging to armed groups backed by the regime near the Colombian border.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The US could also conceivably launch strikes against the Venezuelan military, or conduct drone strikes, special operations raids, or covert actions targeting senior officials, including Maduro himself. The precedent here would be the 1989 invasion of Panama which resulted in the overthrow and arrest of dictator Manuel Noriega, who, like Maduro, had been indicted in the US on drug charges.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">While many Venezuelans would be happy to see Maduro gone, and although senior figures in the country’s opposition, including Nobel Peace Prize winner Maria Corina Machado, <a href=\"https://thehill.com/policy/international/5582905-maria-corina-machado-venezuela-trump-boat-strikes/\">have backed Trump’s actions so far</a>, overthrowing the regime would be risky. A US government war game <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/20/us/politics/venezuela-maduro-fallout-trump.html\">conducted during Trump’s first term</a> predicted that Maduro’s overthrow would create a power vacuum with rival military units, political factions, and armed groups fighting for control. Possibly most concerning for this administration, it could also trigger another mass migration of Venezuelan refugees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading has-text-align-none\"><strong>Is any of this legal?&nbsp;</strong></h2>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The president’s authority to unilaterally order military action has been stretched pretty far by several administrations over the past few decades, and the Trump administration has borrowed from the rhetoric of the post-9/11 war on terrorism to justify its boat strikes. (Hegseth has described drug cartels as the “<a href=\"https://x.com/SecWar/status/1979930208472912048\">al-Qaeda of the Western Hemisphere</a>.” But even by the standards of that legally murky era, its <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/central-america-caribbean/america-unbound-caribbean\">justifications are a stretch</a>. Unlike after 9/11, Congress has not passed an authorization for the use of military force against drug cartels or the Venezuelan government. While drug addiction may be a societal scourge, there has been no incident comparable to a massive terrorist attack that could constitute an imminent threat the administration must respond to with deadly force without congressional authorization.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Historically, drug traffickers are considered <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2025/10/06/politics/classified-justice-department-memo-cartel-strikes\">criminals with due process rights</a>, not enemy combatants. The administration may have designated “Cartel de los Soles” and other criminal groups as terrorist organizations, but that does not, in itself, authorize military action against them. It definitely does not authorize the use of deadly force against civilian ships in international waters, giving them no chance to surrender, as the US has done repeatedly over the past few weeks. Giving the survivors of a strike no chance to surrender, as the Washington Post report alleges the US military did on Hegseth’s orders, is “especially forbidden” <a href=\"https://www.execfunctions.org/p/a-dishonorable-strike?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email\">under international law</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Trump administration lawyers have reportedly told Congress that the current legal authority, under which they are carrying out the boat strikes, does not <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/11/06/politics/trump-venezuela-legal-congress-land\">cover strikes on land in Venezuela</a>. However, CNN reported last month, they are seeking a separate legal opinion from the Justice Department that would allow them to carry out those strikes without going to Congress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">“What is true one day may very well not be the next,” one official told CNN — a sentence that could sum up much of this whole situation.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Update, December 11, 2025, 4 pm ET: </strong>This story was originally published on December 1 and has been updated to reflect recent events. </em></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><em><strong>Correction, January 3, 2026, 10:50 am: </strong>This story originally misstated the year Hugo Chavez came to power; it was 1999.</em></p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",

And that’s happening amid a changed cocaine landscape, one that’s evolved from the kingpin-run trade of the ’80s. The drug might conjure images of Pablo Escobar and Al Pacino’s Scarface, but today’s reality is less the big bad coke boss and more like a proliferation of smaller outfits trafficking in cocaine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">As Schmidt told <em>Today, Explained</em> cohost Jonquilyn Hill, “It is a much more globalized business than before, and it works in an entirely new way that makes it much more difficult to combat.”</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Below is an excerpt of their conversation, edited for length and clarity. There’s much more in the full episode, so listen to <em>Today, Explained</em> wherever you get podcasts, including <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/today-explained/id1346207297\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.pandora.com/podcast/today-explained/PC:140\">Pandora</a>, and <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/3pXx5SXzXwJxnf4A5pWN2A\">Spotify</a>.</p>\n\n<iframe frameborder=\"0\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://playlist.megaphone.fm/?e= VMP5247217537\" width=\"100%\"></iframe>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How big is the global cocaine trade right now?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Year after year it is breaking records. The land in Colombia that is used to cultivate cocaine is about more than five times the size than during the Pablo Escobar years. Today it is so much bigger, and we see both demand and supply surging in many parts of the world. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Seizures in Europe [are] growing to levels that now rival the United States as a main destination point. <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/09/22/world/americas/medellin-colombia-pablo-escobar.html\">Pablo Escobar</a> was killed in 1993, so up until that point, that was when the United States was really focused on cocaine and trying to tackle the cocaine trade and the cartels moving it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">But that was a very different era. Now it is globalized. We are talking about a proliferation of smaller, much more nimble, very strategic drug trafficking organizations across South America.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>What&#8217;s driving that growth?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We are seeing demand soaring in countries that previously were not considered main markets. Europe now is a top destination alongside the United States.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Some of it is also supply-side. We are seeing within Colombia just the amount of land with cocaine, and the productivity of that land, is so much higher than before. And when you talk to experts, some of that is explained by the way that they&#8217;ve created these cocaine enclaves where they not only have much more productive land, they grow a lot more of the crop (the base plant is called coca). It&#8217;s way more productive, and they&#8217;ve managed to concentrate these enclaves near the borders and near the coasts so they can quickly move it out. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">And before, we had one or two main armed groups that controlled the trade in Colombia. Now because of the <a href=\"https://www.peaceagreements.org/agreements/wgg/1845/\">peace negotiations in 2016</a> and the collapse of those peace negotiations and the aftermath of that, it&#8217;s also sort of opened up the country to criminal networks from around the world.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>We&#8217;re talking about how the trade has expanded via cultivation methods and diversified markets and logistics. It feels like we&#8217;re talking about any other kind of business.</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Absolutely. Much of this is happening on legal container ships. Sometimes you do see these crazy stories about these submarines ending up in Australia, and these go-fast boats in the Caribbean, but a lot of times it&#8217;s legal container ships that are leaving through legal ports. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">A lot of what has also allowed this explosion in the cocaine trade is corruption. It&#8217;s buying off people in the ports, in the police, in the courts. So it&#8217;s going to be a lot harder to get rid of this when it has infiltrated every level of the state.</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\"><strong>How is law enforcement dealing with this new era of the cocaine trade?</strong></p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">So the answer to that depends on whether you&#8217;re talking about last year or this year under the Trump administration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">Last year I think the focus was on trying to dismantle the criminal structures from the top. Fast-forward to this year, and in the current moment we&#8217;re in, the Trump administration has taken a vastly different approach. They have had this massive buildup of the military in particular, the Navy in the Caribbean, and in many parts of the waters in Latin America, and have been bombing drug boats at sea that they allege are drug traffickers moving drugs to the United States. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">The Trump administration is saying that this is a threat, that these are “narco terrorists” flooding the United States with drugs, and they talk about it in a way that implies that fentanyl is moving on these boats when we know that it is predominantly cocaine. </p>\n\n<p class=\"has-text-align-none\">We don&#8217;t really hear the Trump administration talking about cocaine and the specifics of that trade as much as we hear them talk about the fentanyl crisis. So we&#8217;re kind of conflating two things here.</p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t",
